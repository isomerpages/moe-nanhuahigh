<p><strong>Mr Chiew Jing Wen, Principal</strong>
</p>
<p>A very warm greeting to all students and parents in our Nan Hua Family.
As the 25th Principal of Nan Hua High School, I am extremely proud of our
vibrant Nan Hua community, which characterises our love for learning, our
compassion for all, and our zest for life as Nanhuarians. I am confident
that our new Sec 1 students will also find in Nan Hua High School a nest
where you can learn and grow.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>An Institution of Bicultural Learning</strong>
<br>As a centenary institution founded in 1917 through a philanthropic spirit
to champion a better society for all, Nan Hua has grown from strength to
strength over our 108 years to nurture generations of Nanhuarians who strive
for excellence in life while remaining anchored in our unique sense of
bicultural identity. Living out our school culture of Ren (仁), Excellence,
Learning, and Collegiality in their interactions with peers and teachers
with whom they learn and grow, our Nanhuarians carry a youthful exuberance,
confidence, and spark which set them apart and place them in good stead
to make the most of opportunities that come their way.</p>
<p>Nan Hua stands proud and tall today, in large part because of our deeply-committed
and fiercely-dedicated staff. The tremendous support from our School Advisory
Committee (SAC), our Parents Support Group (PSG), our Nan Hua Alumni, and
our community partners, has also enabled meaningful opportunities for our
students’ development over the years. Through their labour of love, our
Nanhuarians can appreciate our bicultural identity with grateful humility,
develop a sense of positive purpose to pursue their passion, and find meaningful
balance and buoyancy in life and learning, through our unique Nan Hua experience.</p>
<p><strong>Our New Nan Hua Vision &amp; Mission (2025 – 2028)</strong>
<br>With gratitude for the strong foundations laid by our predecessors and
in appreciation of our vibrant Nan Hua culture, I was privileged to journey
together with our Nan Hua family as Principal, to chart the next lap for
Nan Hua High School. This re-envisioning journey has taken us more than
a year in conversation, as we wanted to do our best to hear the different
voices of our staff, our students, and our key stakeholders; sense our
hopes and aspirations; so that we can move forward with a new set of Nan
Hua vision and mission that connects us as one Nan Hua community; encourages
every Nanhuarian heartbeat; and honours our Nan Hua identity.</p>
<p>As an educator, the holistic development of our students’ character, confidence,
and capacity to care and contribute is very close to my heart. Amidst the
winds of change that are upon our society and the global landscape, we
need to prepare our children differently, for a future markedly different
from what our schooling experiences prepared us for. I am heartened that
our staff in Nan Hua shares this heartbeat. We must therefore deepen the
strong foundations for bicultural learning that Nan Hua has laid over the
years and empower our Nanhuarians to grow holistically as learners of learning,
beyond merely students of subjects.
<br>
<br>I am excited to share our new Nan Hua vision, for us to grow as a community
of:
<br><strong>Curious Learners . Cultured Scholars . Courageous Leaders<br>乐学善思 | 文质彬彬 | 当仁不让</strong>
<br>who embrace tradition and embody the spirit of Junzi (君子) in pursuing
learning for our inner cultivation, with our timeless Nan Hua values (忠，孝，仁，爱，礼，义，廉，耻)
as our moral compass, so that we may lead with courage, compassion, and
humility in our outward contribution in championing a better society.</p>
<p>As a school, we strive to achieve this vision through our mission, to
nurture:
<br>Bicultural Nanhuarians who are Confident, Compassionate, and Culturally
Versatile, with a Passion for Life.
<br>有信心、有仁爱精神、具备跨文化素养，
<br>并对生活充满热忱的南华双文化君子</p>
<p></p>

<p>As an educator, the holistic development of students’ character, confidence,
and capacity to care and contribute is very close to my heart. Amidst the
winds of change that are upon our society and the global landscape, we
need to prepare our children differently, for a future markedly different
from what our schooling experiences prepared us for. It will therefore
be important to deepen the strong foundations for bicultural learning that
Nan Hua has laid over the years and enrich the Nan Hua Experience while
seeking healthy equilibrium in holistic development, so that generations
of future Nanhuarians will also benefit in their learning. This will help
Nanhuarians learn to sense-make with purpose, make connections for growth&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;innovation,
and strive for excellence with a healthy sense of balance and buoyancy
while remaining well-grounded in our timeless Nan Hua values (忠，孝，仁，爱，礼，义，廉，耻)
as their moral compass.</p>
<p>Last year, our school theme of <strong>Pursuing Passion, Gratitude in Action</strong> – <strong>心存感恩、逐梦前行</strong> –
has inspired us to enrich our Nan Hua Life with vibrance, energy, and passion.
Let us bring forth our Nan Hua Spirit once again for 2024, borne out of
our zest for learning and deep sense of camaraderie, to step into the new
year with vigour and purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year, our school theme for 2024 of <strong>Riding the Waves, Pursuing Our Dreams</strong> – <strong>扬帆起航、乘风逐梦</strong> –
reminds us that each of us are on our personal voyage of learning and adventure.
On this journey, we will meet with waves that can overcome us, or allow
us to ride higher and further. To ride the waves on our voyage of adventure,
we must harness the winds to chase our dreams, by being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Positively Purposeful</strong> and <strong>Resourcefully Buoyant</strong>,
so that we develop the confidence to manage and master the ups and downs
of life and learning;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Selflessly Compassionate</strong> and <strong>Gratefully Giving</strong>,
recognising that we are not alone as voyagers, so that we uplift one another
and encourage our hearts as a Nan Hua Family; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Graciously Humble</strong> and <strong>Adaptively Agile</strong>,
so that we embrace our Nan Hua values, bicultural identity, and rich heritage
as anchors of cultural strength, which enable us to harness opportunities
with nimbleness and cultural versatility in our voyage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With these qualities, our Nanhuarians will grow to be confident, compassionate,
and culturally versatile – not just during their Nan Hua days, but throughout
their lives even beyond Nan Hua.</p>
<p>Our hope is for all Nanhuarians to build deep friendships, discover their
passions and strengths, and harness these strengths for good – to uplift
those around us in our Nan Hua Family and serve our community. In this
regard, we appreciate our close partnership with the School Advisory Committee
(SAC), the Parents Support Group (PSG), the Nan Hua Alumni, and our community
partners, who have supported meaningful opportunities for our students’
development over the years.&nbsp;“根植传统，放眼世界，回馈社会” –&nbsp;这是我们南华人的理念。At
the end of their four years in Nan Hua High School, we look forward to
seeing each and every Nanhuarian emerge with confidence as world-ready
Bicultural Scholars who not only embrace tradition, but also lead with
courage and humility as champions of society.&nbsp;</p>
