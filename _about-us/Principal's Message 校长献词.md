<div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Mr Chiew Jing Wen, Principal" src="/images/Mr%20Chiew%20Jing%20Wen.jpg"></div><p><strong>Mr Chiew Jing Wen, Principal</strong></p><p>A very warm greeting to all students and parents in our Nan Hua Family. As the 25th Principal of Nan Hua High School, I have been very encouraged by the warmth and energy of all our students and staff, and experienced first-hand Nanhuarians’ passion for excellence in learning. I am confident that our new Sec 1 students will also find in Nan Hua High School a nest where you can learn and grow.</p><p>As an institution of bicultural learning, Nan Hua High School strives to nurture confident, creative, and cultured Nanhuarians with a passion for learning. Under the leadership of the esteemed Principals before me, the school has grown from strength to strength over 107 years to provide a conducive environment that has nurtured generations of Nanhuarians, who strive for excellence in life while remaining anchored in our unique sense of bicultural identity.&nbsp;</p><p>Nan Hua High School stands proud and tall today, in large part because of our deeply-committed and fiercely-dedicated staff. Through their labour of love, our Nanhuarians carry a youthful exuberance, confidence, and spark which set them apart and place them in good stead to make the most of opportunities that come their way. At the same time, Nanhuarians live out our school culture of&nbsp;<strong><em>R</em></strong><em>en</em>&nbsp;(仁),&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>xcellence,&nbsp;<strong>L</strong>earning, and&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>ollegiality in their interactions with peers and teachers, with whom they learn and grow. As the Nan Hua Experience attests, “一日南华人，一世南华情” – the camaraderie and affection that our Nanhuarians demonstrate for the school, even after they step out of our&nbsp;礼义之门&nbsp;in graduation, is a powerful testament to the impact of Nan Hua in their lives.</p><p>As an educator, the holistic development of students’ character, confidence, and capacity to care and contribute is very close to my heart. Amidst the winds of change that are upon our society and the global landscape, we need to prepare our children differently, for a future markedly different from what our schooling experiences prepared us for. It will therefore be important to deepen the strong foundations for bicultural learning that Nan Hua has laid over the years and enrich the Nan Hua Experience while seeking healthy equilibrium in holistic development, so that generations of future Nanhuarians will also benefit in their learning. This will help Nanhuarians learn to sense-make with purpose, make connections for growth&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;innovation, and strive for excellence with a healthy sense of balance and buoyancy while remaining well-grounded in our timeless Nan Hua values (忠，孝，仁，爱，礼，义，廉，耻) as their moral compass.</p><p>Last year, our school theme of <strong>Pursuing Passion, Gratitude in Action</strong> – <strong>心存感恩、逐梦前行</strong> – has inspired us to enrich our Nan Hua Life with vibrance, energy, and passion. Let us bring forth our Nan Hua Spirit once again for 2024, borne out of our zest for learning and deep sense of camaraderie, to step into the new year with vigour and purpose.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>This year, our school theme for 2024 of <strong>Riding the Waves, Pursuing Our Dreams</strong> – <strong>扬帆起航、乘风逐梦</strong> – reminds us that each of us are on our personal voyage of learning and adventure. On this journey, we will meet with waves that can overcome us, or allow us to ride higher and further. To ride the waves on our voyage of adventure, we must harness the winds to chase our dreams, by being:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Positively Purposeful</strong> and <strong>Resourcefully Buoyant</strong>, so that we develop the confidence to manage and master the ups and downs of life and learning;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Selflessly Compassionate</strong> and <strong>Gratefully Giving</strong>, recognising that we are not alone as voyagers, so that we uplift one another and encourage our hearts as a Nan Hua Family; and</p></li><li><p><strong>Graciously Humble</strong> and <strong>Adaptively Agile</strong>, so that we embrace our Nan Hua values, bicultural identity, and rich heritage as anchors of cultural strength, which enable us to harness opportunities with nimbleness and cultural versatility in our voyage.</p></li></ul><p>With these qualities, our Nanhuarians will grow to be confident, compassionate, and culturally versatile – not just during their Nan Hua days, but throughout their lives even beyond Nan Hua.</p><p>Our hope is for all Nanhuarians to build deep friendships, discover their passions and strengths, and harness these strengths for good – to uplift those around us in our Nan Hua Family and serve our community. In this regard, we appreciate our close partnership with the School Advisory Committee (SAC), the Parents Support Group (PSG), the Nan Hua Alumni, and our community partners, who have supported meaningful opportunities for our students’ development over the years.&nbsp;“根植传统，放眼世界，回馈社会” –&nbsp;这是我们南华人的理念。At the end of their four years in Nan Hua High School, we look forward to seeing each and every Nanhuarian emerge with confidence as world-ready Bicultural Scholars who not only embrace tradition, but also lead with courage and humility as champions of society.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Chiew Jing Wen 周景文<br>Principal 校长</p>
