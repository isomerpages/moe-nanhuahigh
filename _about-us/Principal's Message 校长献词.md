<p><strong>Mr Chiew Jing Wen, Principal</strong>
</p>
<p>A very warm greeting to all students and parents in our Nan Hua Family. As the 25th Principal of Nan Hua High School, I am extremely proud of our vibrant Nan Hua community, which characterises our love for learning, our compassion for all, and our zest for life as Nanhuarians. I am confident that our new Sec 1 students will also find in Nan Hua High School a nest where you can learn and grow.</p>

<p><strong>An Institution of Bicultural Learning</strong>
<br>As a centenary institution founded in 1917 through a philanthropic spirit
to champion a better society for all, Nan Hua has grown from strength to
strength over our 109 years to nurture generations of Nanhuarians who strive
for excellence in life while remaining anchored in our unique sense of
bicultural identity. Living out our school culture of&nbsp;<strong><em>R</em></strong><em>en</em>&nbsp;(仁), <strong>E</strong>xcellence, <strong>L</strong>earning,
and <strong>C</strong>ollegiality in their interactions with peers and teachers
with whom they learn and grow, our Nanhuarians carry a youthful exuberance,
confidence, and spark which set them apart and place them in good stead
to make the most of opportunities that come their way.</p>
<p>Nan Hua stands proud and tall today, in large part because of our deeply
committed and fiercely dedicated staff. The tremendous support from our
School Advisory Committee (SAC), our Parent Support Group (PSG), our Nan
Hua Alumni, and our community partners, has also enabled meaningful opportunities
for our students’ development over the years. Through their labour of love,
our Nanhuarians can appreciate our bicultural identity with grateful humility,
develop a sense of positive purpose to pursue their passion, and find meaningful
balance and buoyancy in life and learning, through our unique Nan Hua experience.</p>
<p>As an educator, the holistic development of our students’ character, confidence,
and capacity to care and contribute is very close to my heart. Amidst the
winds of change that are upon our society and the global landscape, we
need to prepare our children differently, for a future markedly different
from what our schooling experiences prepared us for. I am heartened that
our staff in Nan Hua shares this heartbeat. We must therefore deepen the
strong foundations for bicultural learning that Nan Hua has laid over the
years and empower our Nanhuarians to grow holistically as <strong>learners of learning for life, beyond merely students of subjects in school</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Our New Nan Hua Vision &amp; Mission (2025 – 2028)</strong>
<br>With gratitude for the strong foundations laid by our predecessors and
in appreciation of our vibrant Nan Hua culture, our Vision in Nan Hua High
School reflects the voices, hopes, and aspirations of our staff, our students,
and our key stakeholders – to honour our Nan Hua identity, to encourage
every Nanhuarian heartbeat, and to connect us as one Nan Hua community
of:</p>
<p></p><center><strong>Curious Learners . Cultured Scholars . Courageous Leaders<br>乐学善思 | 文质彬彬 | 当仁不让</strong></center>
<p></p>
<p>who embrace tradition and embody the spirit of <em>Junzi</em> (君子) in pursuing
learning for our inner cultivation, so that we may lead with courage, compassion,
and humility towards a better society in our outward contribution.</p>
<p>As a school, we strive to achieve this vision through our mission, to
nurture:</p>
<p>
	</p><center>
	<strong><em>Bicultural Nanhuarians who are <br>Confident, Compassionate, and Culturally Versatile, <br>with a Passion for Life.</em></strong>
<p></p>
<p><strong>有信心、有仁爱精神、具备跨文化素养，<br>并对生活充满热忱的南华双文化君子</strong>
</p></center>

<p>We believe that each Nanhuarian must develop a passion not just for learning
but for life, and be able to:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Embrace the cultural strengths of
our Chinese values and traditions and harness their individual character
strengths, to develop a healthy sense of identity with confidence;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uphold <em>Ren</em> (仁 Humanity) in
exercising empathy and thoughtful consideration for the well-being of others,
to uplift lives around them with selfless compassion; and</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appreciate perspectives and experiences
across cultures and contexts with humility and sensitivity, to collaborate
respectfully in strengthening our multi-cultural society with cultural
versatility.</p>
<p>Our timeless Nan Hua values (忠，孝，仁，爱，礼，义，廉，耻) will remain as our moral
compass, guiding us in learning and in life. Through their journey with
us, we will support every Nanhuarians to develop the confidence to sense-make
with purpose, make connections for growth&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;innovation,
and strive for excellence with a healthy sense of balance and buoyancy
in life.</p>
<p><strong>Our School Theme for 2026</strong>
<br>Last year, our school theme of <strong>Strength in Identity, Passion in Community </strong> – <strong> 南华同心，众彩生辉 </strong>encouraged
all Nanhuarians to draw strength from our bicultural Nan Hua identity,
to grow in confidence, compassion, and cultural versatility, and harness
our collective passion as a Nan Hua community to give back to our society.</p>
<p>This year, we will build on the growth we have made as a Nan Hua Family,
through our 2026 school theme of <strong>Growing Our Hearts, Shining Our Light</strong> – <strong>正心修身，推己及人</strong>.
“Growing Our Hearts” highlights the importance of nurturing our hearts
in this world of tech and flux, for our identity, convictions and purpose
must continue to be shaped by our timeless Nan Hua values and bicultural
Nan Hua identity. When we grow our hearts, we do so not just as individual
Nanhuarians with compassion, empathy, and humanity, but also as a Nan Hua
Family by connecting, uplifting, and encouraging fellow Nanhuarians. “Shining
Our Light" illuminates the positive footprint we can each bring into the
communities around us, where new life can bloom along the trails we walk
together.</p>
<p>As the Nan Hua experience attests, “一日南华人，一世南华情” – the camaraderie and
affection of our Nanhuarians for the Nan Hua that they love, even after
stepping out of our&nbsp;礼义之门&nbsp;in graduation, is a powerful testament
to the impact of Nan Hua in their lives. As Nanhuarians, our passion must
enrich lives beyond our own, and our impact must likewise reach beyond
our school. With our passion as a community, let us illuminate the path
for. When we shine our light, we live out our passion and purpose – our
light can be an encouragement to unite our society in collective action,
just as it can also bring new hope into the lives of those in our society
who need it the most.</p>
<p>Our hope for all Nanhuarians is to build deep friendships, discover their
passions and strengths, and harness these strengths for good – to uplift
our society as a Nan Hua Family. 根植传统，放眼世界，回馈社会 –&nbsp;这是我们南华人的理念。At the
end of their four years in Nan Hua High School, we look forward to seeing
each and every Nanhuarian emerge with confidence as <strong>Curious Learners</strong>, <strong>Cultured Scholars</strong>,
and <strong>Courageous Leaders</strong> who not only embrace tradition and
pursue learning for inner cultivation, but also lead with courage, compassion,
and humility towards a better society in outward contribution. 愿每一名南华学生都能成为<strong> 乐学善思、文质彬彬、当仁不让 </strong>的南华人。</p>
<p>May we look forward to a fruitful and fulfilling 2026!</p>
