As the 25th Principal of Nan Hua High School, I have been very encouraged by the warmth and energy of all our students and staff who have welcomed me, and experienced first-hand Nanhuarians’ passion for excellence in learning. I am confident that our new Sec 1 students will also find in Nan Hua High School a nest where you can learn and grow.</p><p>As an institution of bicultural learning, Nan Hua High School strives to nurture confident, creative, and cultured Nanhuarians with a passion for learning. Under the visionary leadership of retiring Principal Mrs Tan Jong Lek, Nan Hua has grown from strength to strength over the past 13 years to provide a conducive environment that has nurtured generations of Nanhuarians who strive for excellence in life while remaining anchored in our unique sense of bicultural identity. On behalf of all our staff and generations of Nanhuarians, I thank Mrs Tan for her able stewardship of Nan Hua over the years and wish her the very best in her future endeavours in retirement.</p><p>Nan Hua High School stands proud and tall today, in large part because of our deeply-committed and fiercely-dedicated staff. Through their labour of love, our Nanhuarians carry a youthful exuberance, confidence, and spark which set them apart and place them in good stead to make the most of opportunities that come their way. At the same time, Nanhuarians live out our school culture of&nbsp;<strong><em>R</em></strong><em>en</em>&nbsp;(仁),&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>xcellence,&nbsp;<strong>L</strong>earning, and&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>ollegiality in their interactions with peers and teachers, with whom they learn and grow. As the Nan Hua Experience attests, “一日南华人，一世南华情” – the camaraderie and affection that our Nanhuarians demonstrate for the school, even after they step out of our&nbsp;礼义之门&nbsp;in graduation, is a powerful testament to the impact of Nan Hua in their lives.</p><p>As an educator, the holistic development of students’ character, confidence, and capacity to care and contribute is very close to my heart. Amidst the winds of change that are upon our society and the global landscape, we need to prepare our children differently, for a future markedly different from what our schooling experiences prepared us for. It will therefore be important to deepen the strong foundations for bicultural learning that Nan Hua has laid over the years and enrich the Nan Hua Experience while seeking healthy equilibrium in holistic development, so that generations of future Nanhuarians will also benefit in their learning. This will help Nanhuarians learn to sense-make with purpose, pursue growth&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;innovation, and strive for excellence with a healthy sense of balance and buoyancy while remaining well-grounded in our timeless Nan Hua values (忠，孝，仁，爱，礼，义，廉，耻) as their moral compass.</p><p>Our hope is for all Nanhuarians to build deep friendships, discover their passions and strengths, and harness these strengths for good – to uplift those around us in our Nan Hua Family and serve our community. In this regard, we appreciate our close partnership with the School Advisory Committee (SAC), the Parents Support Group (PSG), the Nan Hua Alumni, and our community partners, who have supported meaningful opportunities for our students’ development over the years.&nbsp;“根植传统，放眼世界，回馈社会” –&nbsp;这是我们南华人的理念。At the end of their four years in Nan Hua High School, we look forward to seeing each and every Nanhuarian emerge with confidence as world-ready Bicultural Scholars who not only embrace tradition, but also lead with courage and humility to serve as champions of society.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Chiew Jing Wen 周景文 <br>Principal 校长</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="https://nanhuahigh.moe.edu.sg/pix/spacer.gif"></div><p></p>
