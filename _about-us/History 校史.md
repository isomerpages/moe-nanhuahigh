<h3>Early Days</h3>
<p>The early 1900s was a period of political upheaval in China and as a result,
many Chinese fled their homeland to the British Straits Settlements, including
Singapore, in search of a better future. During Dr Sun Yat-Sen’s visits
to Singapore between 1906 and 1910, he encouraged the Chinese in Singapore
to establish public schools for the younger generation and to champion
education for girls. This set in motion the establishment of numerous Chinese
schools in Singapore during the 1910s. In 1914, Yeung Ching School began
admitting female students. However, the school had to end this initiative
in 1916 due to insufficient funds.</p>
<p>Distressed by the thought of female students losing their opportunity
to receive formal education, the Principal of Tao Nan School, Mr Xiong
Shangfu, garnered support from overseas Chinese businessmen in Singapore
to establish a public girls’ school, and their collective efforts led to
the founding of Nam Wah Girls’ School (NHGS) on 14 June 1917. Mr He Zhongying,
one of the key businessmen involved, became the first Chairman of the School
Board, while Mdm Wu Mulan was appointed as the school’s first principal.</p>
<p>NHGS had a humble beginning in a makeshift school on Coleman Street with
fewer than 100 Chinese girls. The school population grew rapidly, and soon,
there was a need for bigger premises to accommodate the growing numbers.
In the ensuing years, plans were made for a new school building on Bencoolen
Street, which was ready in 1921. In 1924, the school was closed temporarily
due to financial problems. After a series of public appeals, generous contributions
of funds enabled debts to be settled, and the school reopened.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the school population continued to grow
as the school not only provided education for students but also offered
the Basic Teacher Training Programme from 1928. This resulted in space
constraint again, and a second move was initiated. In 1941, the new school
building at Adis Road was ready. The Main School had primary classes as
well as training classes for teachers. The old building at Bencoolen Street
functioned as the Branch School for primary classes only. In that same
year, tragedy struck when the Japanese invaded Singapore. The school at
Adis Road was turned into the headquarters for the Japanese Imperial Army
and forced to close again.</p>

<h3>Post World-War 2</h3>
<p>In October 1945, the school reopened after the return of the Allied forces.
The School Management Committee (SMC) immediately set out to raise funds
to rebuild the school and to enrol students again. With overwhelming financial
support from many parents, secondary classes were set up, and the enrolment
rose to 700. The school’s name was officially changed to Nan Hwa Girls’
High School (NHGHS) by the SMC in 1956.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1960s, the curriculum underwent restructuring, and NHGHS
emerged as one of the premier girls’ schools in Singapore. The Branch School
was transformed wholly into a primary school, leaving the Main School as
the secondary school, which terminated the intake of primary students in
1964.</p>
<p>A third move took place on 12 December 1982 when the school moved from
Adis Road to Clementi Ave 1 at the recommendation of the MOE. A momentous
change took place in 1984 when the school began to admit Secondary One
boys. It was a significant event, and to reflect it, the school changed
its name to Nan Hua Secondary School (NHSS).</p>
<p>Another significant change took place on 1 April 1986. The SMC handed
over the administration of the school to the Ministry Of Education (MOE),
thus ending its long-standing status as an aided school.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the school population continued to grow
as the school not only provided education for students but also offered
the Basic Teacher Training Programme from 1928. This resulted in space
constraint again, and a second move was initiated. In 1941, the new school
building at Adis Road was ready. The Main School had primary classes as
well as training classes for teachers. The old building at Bencoolen Street
functioned as the Branch School for primary classes only. In that same
year, tragedy struck when the Japanese invaded Singapore. The school at
Adis Road was turned into the headquarters for the Japanese Imperial Army
and forced to close again.</p>

<h3>In the New Millennium</h3>
<p>In 2000, Nan Hua Secondary School joined the ranks of Singapore's Special
Assistance Programme (SAP) as the 10th SAP school. Under PRIME, the school
was relocated to its current location at 41 Clementi Ave 1 on 20 December
2003. In 2005, the school attained the School of Distinction Award and
the Singapore Quality Class (SQC). In the same year, the new school building
was officially declared open by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 17 July
2005. At its opening, he announced that the school was to be given Autonomous
Status in 2006. With MOE's approval, the name of the school's name was
changed to Nan Hua High School (NHHS) with effect from 1 January 2006.</p>

<p>On 25 April 2007, the SkyGarden was officially opened by the then Minister
for Education and 2nd Minister for Finance, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam.
An innovative teaching and learning space, the SkyGarden is an open area
that has been transformed into a flexible environment for both formal lessons
and student-initiated activities.</p>
<p>2007 marked the school's 90th Anniversary. Current students joined the
Alumni and the Parent Support Group members in the school's celebrations
on 14 July at Swissotel Stamford. An array of performances from students,
staff and Partners in Education cemented the camaraderie and celebrated
the promises that the future holds for Nan Hua.</p>
<p>In 2008, Nan Hua High School collaborated with Nan Hua Primary School
to hold the inaugural Nan Hua Family Local Chinese Cultural Immersion Camp.
That was the first time that staff from the two schools worked together
to organise a joint camp for students of both schools. It marked a key
milestone for schools of the Nan Hua family as we work together to realise
the SAP mission of nurturing bilingual and bicultural students with a deep
appreciation of the Chinese language and culture.</p>
<p>In the following year, Nan Hua High School implemented the SAP Flagship
Programme. This programme aims to develop bilingual who are able to embrace
the wisdom of the modern world as well as appreciate traditional Chinese
values and philosophy.</p>
<p>Besides developing our Flagship Programme, NHHS also developed its strength
in environmental education. In 2010, Nan Hua High School received the President's
Award for the Environment, the highest accolade given to organisations
and companies who have made significant contributions towards environmental
and water resource sustainability in Singapore. The President's Award for
the Environment 2010 was an affirmation of the school's efforts in championing
environmental causes.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, NHHS's Performing Arts Groups have been recognised
for their high standards at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentations.
Students have been invited to perform at many national events, such as
the annual Chingay celebrations and the 2010 Opening Ceremony of the Youth
Olympics. They have also held concerts at public venues such as the Esplanade
and Victoria Concert Hall. Through the many Co-Curricular Activities (CCA),
students learnt to be disciplined, responsible leaders.</p>
<p>In 2011, the school reaffirmed its School of Distinction Award and the
Singapore Quality Class re-certification. It also attained three Best Practice
Awards (BPA) - Teaching and Learning, Student All-Round Development and
Staff Well-Being. These awards are presented to schools that have developed
and deployed innovative, effective systems and processes that lead to desired
staff and student outcomes.</p>
<p>The school was also recognised for its efforts at promoting and strengthening
collaborative partnerships with its stakeholders in the form of the Outstanding
PARTNERS Award given by Education Minister Heng Swee Keat at the MOE Work
Plan Seminar in 2012.</p>

<p>2017 marked a significant milestone in the school’s long history of 100
years. The school brought together many groups of people who contributed
to the school in different ways. “Centennial Excellence, Pioneering Tomorrow-丰泽百年,
再创辉煌” was a memorable celebration of its history and the preservation of
tradition as well as a vision of a school with the confidence to inspire
beyond its centennial. At the Centennial Dinner on 15 Jul 2017, the storyboard
on the conservation of the Adis Road campus was unveiled by Mr Tharman
Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic
and Social Policies.</p>

<p>Following the success of the Centennial Celebrations in 2017, a time capsule
comprising mementoes of items contributed by key members of the school
community was sealed during the school's 101st year. The vision is for
the time capsule to be opened on the school's 125th Speech and Prize-Giving
Day in 2042 for Nanhuarians to remember those who came before them to build
a strong and united Nan Hua community.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Greenhouse and the Hive were opened in 2018 and
2019, respectively, as collaborative spaces for staff and students in their
pursuit of knowledge, skills, competencies and character.</p>
<p>2020 was a challenging year for the school, with Covid-19 affecting school
life. Teachers embraced technology in the face of disruption to normal
lessons to carry out Home-Based Learning (HBL) lessons. The Character Strengths
mural was launched to inspire staff and students to draw on their strengths
to build resilience in the midst of the pandemic. In line with 2020's National
Day theme, an exhibition of “Stronger Together” messages reminded all to
work together to emerge stronger as a school and nation.</p>
