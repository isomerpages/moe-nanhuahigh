Part of the Secondary 1 Orientation Programme, Camp Genesis aims to encourage students to learn and appreciate Nan Hua's unique traditions, culture and heritage while providing students with opportunities to live out the school values. 

The Ceremonial Walk and Campfire which were conducted during the camp strengthened class spirit and developed in students, a stronger sense of belonging to the school.

Camp Cultura aims to develop in our Secondary 2 students a better appreciation of the multi-cultural facets of Singapore society especially the Chinese and Western cultures. 

One highlight of the camp was the Cultural Dance segment. The students were introduced to the movements and choreography of Wushu, Bhangra and Silat and learnt about the origins and development of these cultural forms. 

The learning was beautifully captured and showcased through the class performances at the end of the camp.

Camp Vigour aimed to develop greater resilience and confidence in our Secondary 3 students. Highlights of the camp include the West Coast Park Challenge where students took a short hike to West Coast Park and completed the various station games there and the catapult challenge, where students worked together to obtain materials via tasks and come together to build a functioning catapult. 

The smiles on the faces of all the students are a testament to the bonds forged during the camp.

**Camp Horizon**

To build a spirit of perseverance in our graduating cohort, students embarked on an 11 km walk around the Kallang-Marina Bay Area. See Yue from 403 shared, “It was a very long but memorable walk. At times I felt tired but I preserved and managed to complete the journey. We bonded with our classmates and encouraged each other to strive on!”

Zhao Zijian from 405 reflected: “The expedition was enriching. It truly encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone. It will definitely be a lifelong lesson for me.”

It was heartening that most students felt that they are able to stretch themselves and apply the same kind of endurance to complete their academic journey. 

The walk was also an eye-opener for the Sec 4 students. 

They felt proud as Singaporeans as they realised how beautiful our country is when they walked past many iconic landmarks along the route.

Zhang Naiwen from 409 remarked, “We were pleasantly surprised and amazed by the picturesque scenery. As we walked past the Flower Dome, it looked like something from the future and I realized how advanced Singapore is and felt really grateful to be able to live in Singapore.” 

  

The school is also thankful for the support from the Alumni and Parent Support Group to make this walk a success.
