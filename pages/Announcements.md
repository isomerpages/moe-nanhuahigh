Please take note that due to the Presidential Election on Fri 1st September, our school premises will be handed over to Election Department officials on Thu 31st August after school celebrations with our current students. All non-election officials will not be able to enter the school premises after school dismissal. We strongly encourage you to meet your teachers in school on Fri 22nd September in the evening for Mid-Autumn Festival celebration.
