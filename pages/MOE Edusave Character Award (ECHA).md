The Edusave Character Award (ECHA) is introduced by Ministry of Education in 2012 to enable schools to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions. This is part of the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore in order to broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged and applauded. The award also supports schoolsâ€™ continuing efforts in nurturing students of good values and character, who are active contributors and concerned citizens.

**Objectives of ECHA:**

To recognise outstanding students in each school who are exemplary in character, and who can be role models to inspire others.

**Quota of Awards**

The ECHA maximum quota will be capped at 2% of the total enrolment of Singaporean students in the school.

The school has opened the nomination for ECHA to parents from 25 June to 5 July 2024. Click [here](https://go.gov.sg/nhhsecha2024) for Edusave Character Award Nomination Form (2024) or access the url: https://go.gov.sg/nhhsecha2024
