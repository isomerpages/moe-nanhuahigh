Lunar New Year Celebrations (20 Jan 2023)

“玉兔欢跃开泰运 南华喜迎紫气来”

在周校长主持的鸣锣仪式，以锣声辞旧迎新，南华人满怀欣喜与期待，一同迎接兔年的到来！今年的新年庆祝会除了各大表演艺术团体的演出外，同学们也在班上探讨东西方文化中兔子意象的不同诠释，了解其中的文化差异。接着同学们进行剪纸活动，为庆典增添浓浓的节日气氛。阔别三年，南华全体师生再次齐捞鱼生，为彼此送上最诚挚的新年祝福！佳节送暖，学生代表在校长和副校长的带领下把一个个学生亲手包装的礼篮送给社区中的独居老人，为他们带来温暖与祝福。

Chen Zirong (Sec 2-01) reflected: I fully enjoyed myself as we could lohei with our friends and teachers. I am appreciative of the performing arts CCAs who put in so much effort for the amazing performances. From this experience, I have learnt not to take things for granted, such as the chance to watch performances live. The engaging activities have also helped me immerse in and appreciate the Chinese culture better. I hereby wish everyone a Happy Chinese New Year!
