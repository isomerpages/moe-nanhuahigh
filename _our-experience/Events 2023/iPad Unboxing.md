Excitement fills the air as the students eagerly explore the iPad's capabilities, tapping and swiping their way through the device's various functions and apps.

With their new iPads, each Sec 1 student now joins the rest of the school in having a device that:

1.  develops their digital literacies,
    
2.  supports self-directed and collaborative learning, and
    
3.  enhances teaching and learning. Every Nanhuarian, equipped with a PLD, now has equitable access to digital tools for blended learning, and will be future-ready, confident, creative and cultured learners.
