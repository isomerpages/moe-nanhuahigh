#### Eco-Serve Week
During Eco-Serve Week, students were engaged in Eco-Games, which advocated the importance of sustainability in transport, energy and water conservation. The Parent Support Group (PSG) also demonstrated the use of coffee powder to make eco-friendly body scrubs. At the West Coast Earth Hour 2023, students from 308, Girl Guides and Service Learning Club (SLC) also set up booths to share sustainability tips with the public.

#### National Youth Environment Conference (NYEC)

SLC, together with students from the sKy Programme, organised the 2023 National Youth Environment Conference (NYEC). NYEC provides a platform for students to talk about how policies can shape a sustainable future through a Model United Nations Conference simulation. Students went on learning journeys to Kok Fah Farm, Marina Barrage, Singapore Discovery Centre and Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum to learn more about sustainable efforts locally and around the world. We were also honoured to have Dr Toh Tai Chong, as our Guest-of-Honour.

Mikhail Sergeyevich Parinov of Class 3-07 reflected: “NYEC provided participants an enriching experience through their discussions on environmental issues and through learning journeys. I also deepened my knowledge on sustainable issues and built up my skill in the area of public speaking and planning of events.”

#### Sec 1 CnME module

Sec 1 students learn more about green living through sustainable habits of consumption and the benefits of recycling and upcycling. They also used recycled materials to make eco-lanterns for the celebration of Mid-Autumn in school. Bamboo Girl was also invited to give a talk to the students on sustainable lifestyle.

#### Sec 3 CnME – Our Planet, Our Home

Through the CnME module, students learn about 

1.  Sustainable living and conservation and understand its importance
2.  Wildlife discovery and appreciation through a visit to Singapore River Safari
3.  Innovative ways to promote green living in daily life

#### Sustainable Living

Using our school’s hydroponics system, students learned to grow vegetables from seeds and harvest them for all to enjoy, reducing carbon-footprint and enhancing sustainable living efforts.
