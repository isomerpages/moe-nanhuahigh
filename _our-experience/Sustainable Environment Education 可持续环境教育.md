<p>During Eco-Serve Week, our Environment Champions stepped up to lead their
classmates in engaging, hands-on lessons about conservation and sustainability.
Through games such as <em>Mytopia</em>, where students designed eco-friendly
cities, <em>Recycle Right</em>, which taught proper recycling habits, and <em>Getting to Zero</em>,
where sustainable practices earned high points, students discovered fun
and meaningful ways to protect the planet.</p>

<p>At Assembly, an invited speaker from Terra shared insights on renewable
energy sources and their applications in Singapore and abroad. Upper secondary
students also explored fascinating Black Soldier Fly booth displays, showcasing
how the insects help recycle organic waste. Teachers even had the chance
to test drive Tesla EVs, while students and staff alike were excited to
see the rare Cybertruck on display.</p>

<p>In addition, the 2025 National Youth Environment Conference (NYEC) was
jointly organised by the Service Learning Club (SLC) and students from
the sKy Programme. This platform gave students the opportunity to discuss
how policies can shape a sustainable future through a Model United Nations-style
simulation. To broaden perspectives, participants also embarked on learning
journeys to World Vision, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, the Maritime Port Authority
of Singapore, Marina Barrage, and Gardens by the Bay.</p>
