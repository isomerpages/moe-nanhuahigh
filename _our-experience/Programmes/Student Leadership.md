## STUDENT LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT IN NHHS

With the vision of **developing values-centric leaders** who **bring positive changes to the community** by **serving others through their innovation and thoughtfulness**, the Student Leadership Committee has adopted the essence of both **Innovation Leadership** and **Servant Leadership** models in their student leadership training programme. This is to ensure that student leaders are equipped with the **skills** and **mindset** to use innovative platforms to serve the community and address its needs.

The student leadership development approaches centre on 3 aspects, forming the acronym **A.C.E.**:

**A**ll Inclusivity

All students are given the opportunities to develop his / her leadership capabilities.

**C**ustomised Trainings

Customised training programmes are put in place to cater to the different developmental needs of different groups of student leaders.

**E**xperiential Learning

All student leaders are given opportunities to lead through the various platforms available within and beyond school.

A variety of leadership roles are made available to students, to encourage them to pursue their own leadership development goals and to fulfil the school’s direction of having every student taking up leadership roles in school. An adventure camp is organised for Secondary 3 students at the start of the year as part of this programme. Students are also engaged in student-initiated Values-In-Action (VIA) activities, where students have to propose, plan, organise and execute the VIA activities as a class. These programmes serve as platforms for them to embark on the National Youth Achievement Award (Silver), which serves as the yardstick of one’s self-leadership journey.

Student leaders are also given the autonomy to select the various leadership modules they need to complement their leadership role in the school. The various modules allow student leaders to not just enhance their performance competencies, but also their moral competencies when handling their groups. The modules range from peer-mediation to facilitation skills.

Furthermore, budding student leaders in the Lower Secondary level are hand-picked to attend the Secondary 2 Leaders’ Camp. Secondary 3 students are invited to attend an Overseas Service-Learning Trip to further emphasise on the need for leaders to serve and improve the lives of those beyond Singapore. All student leaders also work together during Project SERVE (SustainablE and Resourceful Volunteering Effort), whereby student leaders are given seed funding from the school to kick-start Service-Learning projects in the respective groups / clusters they are taking charge of, so as to better address and solve the needs of the community within and beyond school.
