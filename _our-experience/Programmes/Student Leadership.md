**_"Every student can be a leader. Every student should be developed as a leader."_**

\-       _2 key beliefs of NH Student Leadership Development Programme -_

  

With the vision on developing values-centric leaders who bring positive changes to the community by serving others through their innovation and thoughtfulness, the Student Leadership Committee has adopted the essence of both Innovation Leadership and Servant Leadership models in their student leadership training programme. This is to ensure that student leaders are equipped with the skills and mindset to use innovative platforms to serve the community and address its needs.

The student leadership development approaches centre on 3 aspects, forming the acronym **A.C.E.**:

**A**ll Inclusivity

All students are given the opportunities to develop his / her leadership capabilities.

**C**ustomised Trainings

Customised training programmes are put in place to cater to the different developmental needs of different groups of student leaders.

**E**xperiential Learning

All student leaders are given opportunities to lead through the various platforms available within and beyond school.

A variety of leadership roles are made available to students, to encourage them to pursue their own leadership development goals and to fulfil the school’s direction of having every student taking up leadership roles in school. An adventure camp is organised for Secondary 3 students at the start of the year as part of this programme. Students are also engaged in student-initiated Values-In-Action (VIA) activities, where students have to propose, plan, organise and execute the VIA activities as a class. These programmes serve as platforms for them to embark on the National Youth Achievement Award (Silver), which serves as the yardstick of one’s self-leadership journey.

Student leaders are also given the autonomy to select the various leadership modules they need to complement their leadership role in the school. The various modules allow student leaders to not just enhance their performance competencies, but also their moral competencies when handling their groups. The modules range from peer-mediation to facilitation skills.

Furthermore, budding student leaders in the Lower Secondary level are hand-picked to attend the Secondary 2 Leaders’ Camp. Secondary 3 students are invited to attend an Overseas Service-Learning Trip to further emphasise on the need for leaders to serve and improve the lives of those beyond Singapore. All student leaders also work together during Project SERVE (SustainablE and Resourceful Volunteering Effort), whereby student leaders are given seed funding from the school to kick-start Service-Learning projects in the respective groups / clusters they are taking charge of, so as to better address and solve the needs of the community within and beyond school.

**Student Reflections**  

I have attended two out of three of the modules so far, namely 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and the Public Speaking module. I have found both of them useful as I am not only applying them in my CCA, but I am also applying them in my daily life.

Firstly, I have used the 7 habits to help myself become a greater and more effective leader. By applying these habits, I am slowly improving myself step by step. During the module, I noticed that I lacked some of the habits, mainly the habit of ‘seeing win-win’. The module had opened my eyes and made me see that I view things in quite a negative light, thinking “win-lose” quite often. I felt that to get a “win”, we would have to sacrifice some aspects and it, thus, results in a “loss”. However, during the module, the teacher-in-charge enlightened me on this, saying that we need to look at things differently as it is possible to transform a “lose-lose” or “win-lose” scenario into a “win-win” scenario. I took this advice and started to use it in my daily life. Whenever I come across any issue with a losing probability, I take a step back and try to decipher how I can turn it into a winning scenario for all parties, and if it is impossible, one winning scenario would be fine as well. This module showed me that everything can turn from negative to positive.

Secondly, I attended the public speaking module. I am not a good public speaker. I attended this module in hopes of improving my public speaking skills, and it did not disappoint. I learnt several things from this module, and it allowed me to be more confident when speaking to a large audience. I especially enjoyed it when the teacher-in-charge allowed us to try our hand at pronouncing bombastic words such as _triskaidekaphobia_. It was an enriching experience indeed!

In conclusion, these two modules I have attended helped me become a better leader and improved me holistically. If I had to recommend modules to any of the juniors, these two modules would top my list! Overall, it was a fantastic learning experience!

The student leadership training such as the environmental workshops and activities in school has greatly boosted my leadership capabilities. For example, during the mass cleaning sessions at the end of every term, my other Environment Champion and I would plan which tasks my classmates would do and how to execute them properly, so that the rest of the classmates can follow suit. I believe that through this activity, both of us can learn and experience how to be a leader and a good role model for other people. Also, the student leadership training, such as the environmental workshops, have contributed to my holistic development. An example would be the Sec 3 level-wide competition that the Environment Champions had painstakingly planned out. It required people from every class to throw their plastic bottles away into a biodegradable bag which will then be sent for recycling. Through this competition and the rest of the environmental workshops, I have learnt a lot about the importance of recycling and why it is crucial to encourage others to start recycling. It changed my thinking on recycling that will leave a lasting impact on me throughout the rest of my life, as well as made me more mindful of my actions the next time I see waste.

The Secondary 1 Broad-Based Leadership Training allowed me to understand that leadership is not just a role, but a form of service towards others, and a way to make a difference.

The Student Leadership Training Programme has helped me grow in my character, as well helped me understand in depth how certain elements in leadership can benefit not only individuals but also those around them. As a class chairperson, I am also able to utilise the skills taught in the sessions to the best of my abilities. My leadership skills have grown throughout this process as I am now able to observe the importance of certain methods of leadership, as well as being able to grow and change as a person. In terms of my holistic development, I have been able to resonate more with the concept of empathy. I am also more aware of the importance of being modest and accepting of any mistakes made.

The Junior Leadership Training Programme (JLTP) gave me a lot of opportunities to step out of my comfort zone, for example, the planning of the Teachers’ Day Celebration allowed me to speak up about the ideas I had and discuss with my peers to better improve on them. The Teachers’ Day Emcee audition also encouraged me to face my fear of speaking confidently in front of a panel of teachers or audience, which is something a leader is frequently required to do. These experiences have taught me to become more confident in guiding others and being a role model that others can look up to.
