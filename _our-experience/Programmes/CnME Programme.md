<p><strong>CnME&nbsp;全能育才课程</strong>
</p>
<p>Background of CnME</p>
<p>Established in 2012, CnME (pronounced as see-and-me) is a holistic life-skills
development programme for all Secondary One to Secondary Three Nanhuarians.
The ‘C’ refers to our school mission: Confident, Compassionate and Culturally
Versatile. The ‘n’ refers to our school niche areas in Environment Education,
Performing Arts and SAP. The ‘ME’ refers to the Nanhuarian developing his/her
21CC, leadership skills and ICT skills. CnME therefore is an outcomes-driven,
student-centric approach to develop students in values and skills that
will bring out the confident, compassionate and culturally versatile Nanhuarian.</p>

<p><strong>CnME: A Fortified Lifestyle 2023</strong>
</p>
<p>CnME begins with Oral Communications, Leadership and ICT programmes in
Secondary One, Values-in-Action and niche programmes in Secondary Two,
and culminates in the Secondary Three CnME Modules. CnME aims to inculcate
important life-skills in Nanhuarians through the context of our school
niche areas to develop their confidence, compassion and cultural versatility.</p>
<p>The skills acquired from the CnME lower secondary years provide the foundation
for the Secondary Three students to select a module based on their interests.
The CnME Modules provide opportunities for students to extend their learning
beyond the scope of the academic curriculum and further hone and develop
life skills.</p>
