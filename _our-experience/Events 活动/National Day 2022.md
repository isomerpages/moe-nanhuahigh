It has been 2 years since we have been able to celebrate National Day as one Nan Hua Family, together around the Parade Square and in the School Hall. During our Parade Segment, the audience was treated to the neat and proud students of our Uniformed Groups, coming together to display a Full Parade. This was complemented by the Symphonic Band as they accompanied the flag march-in and played the National Anthem and School Song flawlessly.

The Choir sang loudly and melodiously too, which encouraged the audience to participate wholeheartedly. Next, the English Drama and Debating Club gave an impressive rendition of the Recollections, where they utilized the whole Parade Square to showcase Singapore’s history. This is not forgetting the Secondary 2 Cohort who have been practicing their Mass Dance item weekly. It was heartwarming to hear the combined voices of the whole school during the Assembly programme, blending nicely together to sing with pride and joy. What an experience we had this year and we hope that we can continue to celebrate together in the years to come!
