## World. Nan Hua.


The International Immersion Programme (IIP) was launched in 2006 to develop the cultural intelligence of our students and staff through student exchanges and immersion in a foreign culture. The programme seeks to broaden the perspectives of our students and extend learning beyond the classroom.  
   
In line with our SAP mission, IIP aims to develop our students into world-ready youths with an appreciation of diverse cultures and an understanding of the importance of co-existence and mutual reliance among countries of the world. We envision our students to be bicultural scholars and savvy in their ability to integrate the east and west in thought, speech and in action. This will prepare them for an increasingly multicultural working environment in the future. Through the programme, our students will also be groomed to be the new generation of culturally sensitive leaders capable of leading our nation into the future.  
   
IIP consists of two prongs: an Inbound component that emphasizes on hosting of foreign delegates by our Secondary students and an Outbound component that is anchored on exposure to foreign cultures and environments through overseas immersion.

Through the International Immersion Programme, the school seeks to develop creative, confident and cultured students. Trips away from school and hosting visitors to our school are the two main components of the programme.
