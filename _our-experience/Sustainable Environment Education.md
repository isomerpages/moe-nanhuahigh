### Eco-Serve Week&nbsp;  
  
During Eco-Serve Week, students were engaged in Eco-Craft upcycling booths and Eco-Race during their recess and lunch breaks. The Parent Support Group also gave out Grow Your Own Green kits, and our own hydroponics was harvested for staff. Go Green Day also encouraged all to take public transport or walk to school.

“The Wildlife Buddies module was a truly enriching one as we got to learn how we can conserve and protect wildlife and appreciate its beauty. The trip to River Safari was my favourite part of the module as we were able to explore more about many marine animals. Through the module, we gained better in-depth knowledge on wildlife.”
