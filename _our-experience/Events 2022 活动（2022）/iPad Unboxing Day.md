Our Sec 1 classes were abuzz with excitement as our Sec 1 students received their Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) today.

With their new iPads, each Sec 1 student now joins the rest of the school in having a device that:  

  

1) develops their digital literacies,

  

2) supports self-directed and collaborative learning, and

  

3) enhances teaching and learning. Every Nanhuarian, equipped with a PLD, now has equitable access to digital tools for blended learning, and will be future-ready, confident, creative and cultured learners.

We look forward to seeing what our Sec 1s will create with their PLDs in the coming year ahead!
