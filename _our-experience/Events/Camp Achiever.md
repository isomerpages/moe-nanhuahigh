**Camp Genesis – Secondary One**

| Over the three days, the Secondary One students forged new friendships while bonding over the preparation of their class dance, in anticipation of their campfire performance. With the golden flames of the campfire blazing in the background, each and every secondary one class danced their hearts out. They also proudly walked through the ‘礼仪之门, marking the official start of their journey as a Nanhuarian! | ![](/images/2023%20camp%20genesis%20campfire%20performance.jpg) |

**Camp Cultura – Secondary Two**

| The Secondary Two students were given the opportunity to immerse themselves in an array of activities that raise their awareness of the many cultures in our society. They bravely tried their hands on performing arts such as Chinese opera, English drama, and other traditional dances of various cultures. The eye-opening trip to the teahouses for tea appreciation, gave them a sneak peek to how black tea came about, and how the different types of tea each offered a unique taste. | ![](/images/2023%20camp%20cultura%20hpv.jpg) |
