Highlights of the event include an impressive parade by the Uniformed Groups accompanied by the Symphonic Band, and creative and dynamic dance performances by the Sports CCA groups and Dance Society. The wonderful musical display by our Harp Ensemble also enthralled the audience. On that day, there was also a ceremony to open the refurbished Alumni Room located next to the school canteen. This room has been and will continue to be the focal point for Alumni activities.  
  


  
The event was especially memorable as it was the first time the entire school came together to celebrate the Speech and Prize-giving Day since the pandemic hit. Throughout the morning, the atmosphere in the school was joyous. Everyone could feel the renewed confidence as we took the opportunity to celebrate Nan Hua emerging stronger from the pandemic. Besides celebrating our achievements as a school, the Speech and Prize-Giving Day also reaffirmed our commitment to nurturing new generations of Nanhuarian learners and leaders.  
Our heartiest congratulations to all prize winners, and thank you to all teachers and students who contributed in one way or another to make this 105th Speech and Prize-Giving Day a spectacular success!
