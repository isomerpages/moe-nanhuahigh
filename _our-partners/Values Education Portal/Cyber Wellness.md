## Cyber Wellness


In Nan Hua, we are guided by the MOE’s framework to develop the students’ instinct to take care of their own well-being online and provide opportunities for the advocacy of ethical and responsible behaviours in the cyber space. Core programmes such as assembly talks, Character and Citizenship Education lessons serve to heighten students’ awareness of cyber wellness issues, providing opportunities for students to discuss about the moral implications. Cyber wellness ambassadors are given leadership opportunities to advocate positive use of technology through positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity.

Partnership between parents and schools is essential for a holistic Cyber Wellness Education. We provide talks every semester for parents to keep up-to-date with the latest cyber issues. Through the talks, they understand their motivation for their interests and activities in the cyber space, allowing them to better communicate with them and forge stronger bonds.  ![CyberWellness_Talk.jpg](/images/CyberWellness_Talk.jpg)
