<p>The Aesthetics Department seeks to spark curiosity and nurture creativity
in every student. Through a wide range of Arts programmes, we help students
discover and develop their talents while building confidence in their artistic
abilities. In Lower Secondary, students explore Visual Arts, Music, and
Dance through engaging CnME lessons that give them a rich, hands-on experience
across different art forms. Our Assembly programme also inspires students
to think creatively about sustainability, encouraging them to make art
with resourcefulness and care for the environment. Each year, students
showcase their growth and passion for the arts in vibrant events such as
the Annual Arts Appreciation and Aesthetics Fest, where their learning
and creativity are celebrated as a community.</p>

<p>The Lower Secondary music programme aspires to develop curious listeners,
courageous performers, and culturally versatile music creators. Secondary
1 students learn foundational music theory and apply them in song arrangement
using GarageBand, ukulele accompaniment, and song writing. Secondary 2
students expand their knowledge through ethnic music modules and film music.
Their learning culminates in&nbsp; multiple performances and compositions,
including a simple <em>dikir barat </em>performance, a collaborative fusion
ensemble piece, and the composition of character themes.</p>

<p>Our Art programme nurtures students as creative thinkers, problem solvers,
and reflective individuals. With approaches like Inquiry-Based Learning
and the Gradual Release of Responsibility, students gain ownership and
independence in their learning. As the new syllabus includes more writing,
students explore diverse art-making strategies and find personal meaning
in their work. They build portfolios, experiment with various media, and
through guided critique, learn to appreciate and evaluate art with sensitivity
and insight.</p>

<p>The Design &amp; Technology programme gives students a hands-on introduction
to real-world problem-solving through the Design Thinking Process. They
brainstorm, prototype, and refine ideas into practical solutions while
developing skills in critical thinking, collaboration, and innovation.
Central to the programme is empathy, as students are encouraged to consider
the needs of others so that their designs are creative, relevant, and responsible.</p>
<p>The Food &amp; Consumer Education lessons emphasise on authentic and practical
learning experiences through exploration of nutrition and health, diet-related
diseases, smart shopping and the importance of sustainable consumption
in our lives. Students are guided to develop greater Student Agency so
that they are invested in their learning. They engage in Inquiry-Based
Learning activities to discover and relate nutrition, health and resource-management
concepts to real-life situations. Our active use of ICT tools and platforms
also enables them to develop greater literacy in the subject in more productive
ways.</p>
<p>At Nan Hua High, our Arts programme creates diverse opportunities for
students to become open-minded leaders and encourage them to promote positive
change. According to novelist Thomas Wolfe, “Culture is the Arts elevated
to a set of beliefs”. We hope to nurture our students to realise their
potential, cultivate their creativity and shape their futures with graciousness
and confidence as they grow into cultured NanHuarians.</p>
