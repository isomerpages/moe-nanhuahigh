<p>The Aesthetics Department of Nan Hua High School aims to ignite curiosity
and creativity in students, fostering and refining their artistic abilities
through a variety of Arts programmes. We immerse students in a multimodal
experience of Visual Arts, Music, and Dance enrichment lessons, delivered
during Lower Secondary CnME classes. Our Assembly Programme emphasises
creative approaches to sustainable practices in art-making, encouraging
students to embrace resourcefulness. Lower Secondary students celebrate
their artistic growth through enriching aesthetics programmes, culminating
in the Annual Arts Appreciation (AAA) programme at the end of each year.</p>
<p>The Lower Secondary Music curriculum aims to develop cultured listeners,
confident performers, and creative composers. In Secondary 1, students
learn foundational music theory and apply it in song arrangement using
GarageBand, ukulele accompaniment, and songwriting. In Secondary 2, they
explore ethnic music and film soundtracks, leading to various performance
and composition opportunities, such as dikir barat, fusion ensembles, and
composing soundscapes and character themes.</p>
<p>Our Art Programme is designed to cultivate students into innovative thinkers,
adept problem solvers, and skilled critics by utilising student agency
through the Gradual Release of Responsibility (GRR) model and Inquiry-Based
Learning (IBL) methods. The Lower and Upper Art Programmes provide students
with opportunities to explore and find meaning in their artistic journey
through core learning experiences such as building up their portfolios,
allowing them to express themselves through a variety of multimodal mediums
and visual art forms. Furthermore, students learn to appreciate different
art forms through Art Critique techniques. Additionally, our AAA programme
offers students additional opportunities to expand their artistic abilities
through specialized modules and immersive learning experiences.</p>
<p>The Design &amp; Technology program offers an invaluable opportunity for
Secondary 2 students to engage with and apply the Design Thinking Process
through projects that mirror real-life scenarios. Throughout their training,
students will explore the five stages of the Design Thinking Process, acquiring
various techniques for idea generation and developing practical skills
in adapting to and solving complex problems. This progression enables students
to evolve from novice learners to confident and innovative problem solvers
capable of designing functional products. Guided by empathy, students are
encouraged to approach their designs with a sense of responsibility, ensuring
their creations are both relevant and beneficial.</p>

<p>Food &amp; Consumer Education lessons place much emphasis on authentic,
practical learning experiences through exploration of nutrition and health;
diet-related diseases, smart shopping and the importance of sustainable
consumption in our lives. Students are guided through the GRR model as
they engage in IBL activities to discover and relate nutrition, health
and resource-management concepts to real-life situations. Our active use
of ICT tools and platforms helps them develop greater literacy in the subject
as they navigate choices towards better health.</p>
<p>The Aesthetics Fest, a week-long celebration of artistic expression and
talent, showcases the creativity of Nanhuarians. Held in conjunction with
the annual Cultural Potpourri and Art Exhibition, the event rebrands the
year-end ArtsFest celebration, fostering closer bonds within the Nan Hua
community through engagement in various arts activities and the enjoyment
of artistic achievements and discoveries. The event commences with an Assembly
Programme featuring a Sand-Art Animation performance, introducing students
to diverse art forms. Following this, students participate in a Virtual
Escape Room, which includes quizzes covering four subjects: Art, Music,
Design &amp; Technology, and Food &amp; Consumer Education. Throughout
the week, both school staff and students take part in fringe activities
such as Keychain Design and Making, Tote Bag Design and Painting, and Dream-Catcher
Making. These activities are led by student leaders from the Visual Arts
Cluster, including the Art and Design Club and the Chinese Calligraphy
Club. The process allows participants and leaders alike to gain valuable
experience and confidence in art and craft, with many continuing to create
additional works beyond the event. The Aesthetics Fest concludes with a
public performance (Cultural Potpourri) and art exhibition, both of which
receive high praise from audiences and visitors.</p>

<p>At Nan Hua High School, our Aesthetics programme creates diverse opportunities
for students to become open-minded leaders, encouraging them to promote
positive change and raise awareness. Edgar Degas once claimed: <em>"Art is not what you see, but what you make others see." </em>Our
commitment lies in helping students unlock their potential and creativity,
equipping them with the skills to shape their futures with graciousness
and confidence.&nbsp;</p>
