**Aesthetics Department**

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Aesthetics Department aims to cultivate in our students a passion for the Arts. From Visual Arts, to Music and Dance enrichment lessons conducted during CnMe lessons held for the lower secondary students, these eventful programmes allow students to gain more insight into our multicultural society, and understand the purpose and meaning behind the Arts. Our assembly programme aims to provide inspiration for students to develop artistic interests and challenge them to become masters in a new area of expertise in the Arts.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The lower secondary music curriculum utilizes well-founded pedagogical methods to motivate students to achieve instrumental mastery and performance competency. Secondary One students learn musical theory through ICT platforms and hands-on lessons with musical instruments. Innovative projects such as Creative Ensembles cultivate students’ creativity and confidence. Secondary Two students develop their musical abilities in an Arrangement Module, using the mobile app Garage Band.

It takes a lot of pluck to learn the ukulele!

  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Through the Music Appreciation module, students developed an awareness and appreciation across various cultures.&nbsp;For Lower Secondary Art, lessons were anchored on the Big Ideas from the Lower Secondary Art Syllabus. Using Inquiry-Based-Learning, Secondary One students took on a more personal approach in the process of making art while using useful visual qualities.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Secondary Two students learnt to value their friends’ artwork by collaborating, appreciating and critiquing using Feldman's approach. Higher Art students honed their aesthetic qualities by developing observational skills through effective techniques. Through contextual settings, students produced 2D, 3D and environment artworks. Home-based learning allowed them to deepen their knowledge in Art Theory and art practice independently.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Art programme focuses on nurturing students’ critical thinking, using ‘Big Ideas’ and ‘Inquiry-Based Learning’ to encounter new discoveries through art-making. Students explored societal and cultural perspectives through Fine Arts and Digital Art. Projects are aligned with our school’s environmental initiatives and selected Art movements. Students work together in the annual ArtsFest for cohort exhibition. The Higher Art programme engages students in extensive 2D and 3D mediums, allowing them to expand their repertoire. Students develop both technical and conceptual skills simultaneously as they learn to critique their peers’ artwork positively using the Feldman’s Approach.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Design &amp; Technology exposes students to Design-Thinking and Problem-Solving through group discussions and individual exploration. Empathy, Defining Problem, Ideation, Prototyping and Evaluation are the stages that students go through to solve a real-world problem. They also have hands-on experience with different resistance materials to realize their design ideas while practising workshop safety in handling materials, tools and machines.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Food &amp; Consumer Education lessons emphasise authentic and practical learning experiences through exploration of nutrition and health, diet-related diseases, and the impact of sustainable consumption on our lives.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Students are engaged in robust discussion on food and resource-management topics, as well as on consumer issues. Existing pedagogies such as Inquiry-Based Learning and discourse through Dialogic Talk are enhanced through active use of ICT tools and platforms, helping students develop greater literacy in the subject.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scott Adams once said, “Creativity is allowing you to make mistakes. Art is to know which ones to keep”. The Arts champions the creation of more opportunities for students to further develop their cultural awareness and promote open-mindedness through our Aesthetic programmes. At Nan Hua High, we strive to give students a strong foundation in the Arts to maximise their potential and skillset to be able to confidently face our volatile world.

### Student Reflection

  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Covid-19 made learning harder as I was not able to learn in a physical classroom setting. It was difficult to get face-to-face advice and guidance from the teachers. For example, in DNT, we had to make prototypes using the materials from our home. However, as Circuit Breaker went by, I learnt to manage my time more independently. I realised how precious school is. I had to learn how to use online platforms, such as Zoom and Google Meet, to consult my teachers for advice. Through this, I realised that it was not easy to do my Art, or DNT or Music homework without the presence of a teacher.&nbsp;
