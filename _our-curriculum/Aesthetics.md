**Aesthetics Department**

The Aesthetics Department strives to spark curiosity and creativity in students, developing and enhancing their artistic skills through our diverse Arts programme. We engage in a multimodal world of Visual Arts, Music and Dance enrichment lessons - conducted during Lower Secondary CnMe lessons. Our Assembly Programme highlights innovative ideas, using sustainable practices to create artworks and instil in students the concept of resourcefulness. Lower Secondary students celebrate their learning and enjoy enriching aesthetics programmes through our Annual Arts Appreciation and ArtsFest at the end of the year. 

The Lower Secondary Music curriculum utilizes well-founded pedagogical methods to motivate students to achieve instrumental mastery and performance competency. Secondary 1 students learn music theory through ICT online platforms and hands-on lessons with musical instruments. An Arrangement module, involving GarageBand on the iPad, allows students to develop their musical abilities through technology. Secondary 2 students deepened their musical knowledge through the learning of music from different cultures and genres.

Using the Gradual Release of Responsibility (GRR) and Inquiry-Based Learning approach, our Art programme aims to develop students' creative thinking and craftsmanship through project-based assignments. The Lower Secondary Art programme seeks to expose students to various art forms and empower them with the confidence to express themselves through Visual Art forms. Critical appreciation also forms the bedrock of the programe, as students learn to appreciate artwork. The Higher Art Programme allows students to further develop their artistic skills in both 2D and 3D mediums and provides opportunities for students to develop their artistic voice.

The Design & Technology (D&T) unit engages the Secondary 2 students through Design Thinking Process as they learn to manage their own projects aiming at improving real-life situations. Being new to D&T and having little experience with handling the equipment and tools, the students were guided using the Gradual Release of Responsibility (GRR) model. As they progress, students gain experience and develop confidence in tackling problems and designing functional products. With Empathy guiding their hands and hearts, the students strive to create responsibly while making their designs relevant and useful.

Food & Consumer Education place much emphasis on authentic and practical learning experiences through exploration of nutrition and health, diet-related diseases, and the impact of sustainable consumption on our lives. Students engaged in robust discussion on food and resource-management topics as well as consumer issues. Inquiry-Based Learning and discourse through Dialogic Talk - enhanced through active use of ICT tools and platforms - helped them develop greater literacy in the subject.

Albert Einstein once said : "Art is the expression of the profoundest thoughts in the simplest way." Our Art programmes offer a spectrum of opportunities for our students to blossom into open-minded champions of society, raising awareness and soaring positively. We aim to recognise our students' potential and creativity to the maximum extent for them to acquire the necessary skills to build their own future humbly and confidently.

Secondary One students learn musical theory through ICT platforms and hands-on lessons with musical instruments. Innovative projects such as Creative Ensembles cultivate students’ creativity and confidence. Secondary Two students develop their musical abilities in an Arrangement Module, using the mobile app Garage Band.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Through the Music Appreciation module, students developed an awareness and appreciation across various cultures.&nbsp;For Lower Secondary Art, lessons were anchored on the Big Ideas from the Lower Secondary Art Syllabus. Using Inquiry-Based-Learning, Secondary One students took on a more personal approach in the process of making art while using useful visual qualities.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Secondary Two students learnt to value their friends’ artwork by collaborating, appreciating and critiquing using Feldman's approach. Higher Art students honed their aesthetic qualities by developing observational skills through effective techniques. Through contextual settings, students produced 2D, 3D and environment artworks. Home-based learning allowed them to deepen their knowledge in Art Theory and art practice independently.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Art programme focuses on nurturing students’ critical thinking, using ‘Big Ideas’ and ‘Inquiry-Based Learning’ to encounter new discoveries through art-making. Students explored societal and cultural perspectives through Fine Arts and Digital Art. Projects are aligned with our school’s environmental initiatives and selected Art movements. Students work together in the annual ArtsFest for cohort exhibition. The Higher Art programme engages students in extensive 2D and 3D mediums, allowing them to expand their repertoire. Students develop both technical and conceptual skills simultaneously as they learn to critique their peers’ artwork positively using the Feldman’s Approach.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Design &amp; Technology exposes students to Design-Thinking and Problem-Solving through group discussions and individual exploration. Empathy, Defining Problem, Ideation, Prototyping and Evaluation are the stages that students go through to solve a real-world problem. They also have hands-on experience with different resistance materials to realize their design ideas while practising workshop safety in handling materials, tools and machines.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Students are engaged in robust discussion on food and resource-management topics, as well as on consumer issues. Existing pedagogies such as Inquiry-Based Learning and discourse through Dialogic Talk are enhanced through active use of ICT tools and platforms, helping students develop greater literacy in the subject.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scott Adams once said, “Creativity is allowing you to make mistakes. Art is to know which ones to keep”. The Arts champions the creation of more opportunities for students to further develop their cultural awareness and promote open-mindedness through our Aesthetic programmes. At Nan Hua High, we strive to give students a strong foundation in the Arts to maximise their potential and skillset to be able to confidently face our volatile world.

### Student Reflection

  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Covid-19 made learning harder as I was not able to learn in a physical classroom setting. It was difficult to get face-to-face advice and guidance from the teachers. For example, in DNT, we had to make prototypes using the materials from our home. However, as Circuit Breaker went by, I learnt to manage my time more independently. I realised how precious school is. I had to learn how to use online platforms, such as Zoom and Google Meet, to consult my teachers for advice. Through this, I realised that it was not easy to do my Art, or DNT or Music homework without the presence of a teacher.&nbsp;
