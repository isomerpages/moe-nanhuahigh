<p><strong>1.STEM Endeavors</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>a) STEM Workshop led by Dr Tan Aik Ling (National Institute of Education)</strong>
</p>
<p>Since 2022, the Science Department has embarked on our journey to spearhead
STEM related activities in the school for both staff and students. We had
the privilege of attending a STEM workshop conducted by the eminent Dr
Tan Aik Ling from the National Institute of Education in March this year.
Dr Tan demonstrated, using an engaging activity in which participants designed
a kitchen device for the visually impaired, how the Science curriculum
can be infused with STEM activities to engender engagement in real world
issues, multiple perspectives through role play as well as an appreciation
for how STEM is a part of everyday living.</p>
<p><strong>b) STEM Playground Challenge organized by CPDD, Science Centre and The James Dyson Foundation</strong>
</p>
<p>STEM Playground Challenge 2023 is jointly organised by Curriculum Planning
and Development Division (CPDD), Science Centre Singapore and The James
Dyson Foundation. The main objective of this competition is to encourage
students’ curiosity, creativity and interest through innovation in STEM
challenges. The challenges also develop school spirit alongside 21st Century
Competencies in our students. Our Secondary one and two students did the
school proud by clinching the top spot as the Champion school in STEM Playground
Challenge 1 “CanBridge Hold’Em” held in semester one. In STEM Playground
2023 Challenge 2, “Sea-Rious” held in semester two, we won the Second Prize.
As a recognition of our stellar performance in the STEM challenge activities,
thirty students and two staff were invited to participate in the James
Dyson Foundation Prototyping workshop.The workshop challenges students
to think like engineers – and to turn their ideas into working prototypes.The
school will endeavor to facilitate our students’ journey in exploring STEM
activities with passion and curiosity.</p>
