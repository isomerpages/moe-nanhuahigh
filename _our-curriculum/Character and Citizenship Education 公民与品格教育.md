<p>At Nan Hua High School, the focus of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is on enabling students to actualise the 8 School Values through the pathways of Positive Education, so as to nurture active citizens grounded in values. We believe in creating positive memories and authentic experiences to bring about a student-centric, values-driven education for our Nanhuarians, so that they learn important skills and competencies and use their character strengths to lead flourishing lives in an ever-evolving BANI world.</p><p>The school has introduced a dynamic group of Peer Support Leaders, known as CareForce, comprising dedicated Care Champions from each class. They champion the school's endeavors in fostering a supportive care culture through peer support. While values inculcation and values in action remain the bedrock of CCE at Nan Hua, there is now an increased focus on promoting enhanced mental health among both students and staff through meaningful conversations.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Our Curriculum/CCE/Wellness_week.jpg"></div><p>^Happy Fruits for Wellness Week</p><p>One crucial avenue for facilitating these conversations and fostering positive relationships is the Teacher Interaction with Pupils Sessions (TIPS). Within this platform, teachers assume the role of life coaches, guiding our students in exploring their individual identities, cultivating healthy relationships, and making informed choices. By prioritizing these aspects, our school aims to instill a greater sense of well-being and equip our students with the necessary tools to navigate their academic and personal journeys with grace and determination.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Our Curriculum/CCE/ecg.jpg"></div><p>^Cohort ECG Talk (Left), Work Shadowing with Animal Wellness Centre (Right)</p><p>With the firm belief that all Nan Hua teachers are CCE teachers first, professional development opportunities, such as the termly CCE LeAPS, HQ workshop on ECG counselling, and the annual STAR Seminar, are provided to equip our teachers with the necessary skills, strategies, and mindsets, to be effective CCE teachers. The theme for this year’s STAR Seminar is ‘Unwinding Anxiety’. Staff were introduced to the science of anxiety, its link to habit, and strategies to help themselves and their students to be anxiety-aware in promoting Positive Health.</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Our Curriculum/CCE/STARSeminar_Group_Discussion_3.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Our Curriculum/CCE/STARSeminar_Group_Discussion_2.jpg"></div></th></tr></tbody></table><h4>Citizenship Education</h4><p><strong>Connecting with the Community</strong></p><p>As part of our holistic approach to Citizenship Education (CE), we believe that developing students’ citizenship dispositions through authentic experiences and understanding the world around them is crucial for our students to thrive in this current world climate. Students are provided with opportunities to interact with different communities and to experience living in multicultural Singapore, which helped develop in them values of respect, harmony and a greater sense of belonging. Our Secondary 1 cohort understood more about our Muslim community as they toured the nearby mosque and interacted with community leaders. As our CE Champions guided the younger students of Yuhua Primary School to carry out Racial Harmony Day activities, they learned to value the interaction among students of different races and developed mutual respect.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Our%20Secondary%201%20Students%20touring%20the%20mosque%20and%20learning%20about%20Islamic%20culture.jpg"></div><p>^Secondary 1 Students touring the mosque and learning about Islamic culture.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CE%20Champions%20interacting%20and%20guiding%20students%20of%20Yuhua%20Primary%20School.jpg"></div><p>^CE Champions interacting and guiding students of Yuhua Primary School.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Nan%20Hua%20High%20seniors%20and%20their%20Yuhua%20Primary%20juniors%20who%20collaborated%20at%20the%20RHD%20Programme.jpg"></div><p>^Nan Hua High Seniors and their Yuhua Primary juniors collated at the Racial Harmony Day Programme</p><h4>Developing Student Agency</h4><p>CE Champions took greater ownership of their active citizenry by organising activities for their classmates for all CE programmes, which are designed to develop greater student agency. Students took charge of the Racial Harmony Day dress-up competition and encouraged their classmates to showcase a wide variety of ethnic wear which is reflective of the myriad cultures in Singapore. For International Friendship Day (IFD), students gained a deeper understanding of Singapore’s inter-dependence with the world around them, as they planned activities to engage their peers.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Our Curriculum/CCE/rhd.jpg"></div><p>^Commemorating Racial Harmony Day by wearing our best ethnic costumes</p><blockquote><p>"Though planning for IFD took much time and effort, it was worthwhile as our classmates learnt more about the day and its importance in a fun and interactive manner!"</p><p>Kor Hor Ken and Shane Shahin Shah, 202</p></blockquote><p></p>
