<p><strong>Problem Solving and Computational Thinking</strong>
</p>
<p>Problem solving lies at the heart of mathematics education. The department
integrates Polya’s problem-solving approach and computational thinking
to help students make sense of complexity and approach challenges with
confidence. Through decomposition, pattern recognition, and abstraction,
students learn to break problems into smaller parts, identify useful patterns,
focus on key ideas, and plan logical steps toward a solution. As they design
algorithms and represent them through flowcharts, they develop metacognitive
awareness and a stronger sense of identity as mathematical thinkers<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Generative AI as a Thinking Partner</strong>
</p>
<p>Secondary 3 students explored the responsible use of generative AI through
a hands-on session on prompt engineering. They practiced using AI to guide
their thinking and support their reasoning in trigonometric proofs, learning
how to turn technology into a helpful thinking partner. The experience
encouraged them to take ownership of their problem-solving while developing
skills that are relevant for today’s digital world.</p>
<p><strong><u>Applying mathematics through real-world experiences</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Beyond thinking tools like AI, students also apply mathematics in hands-on,
real-world contexts that make learning tangible and meaningful.</p>
<p><strong>Sec 1 Interdisciplinary Project 2025<br></strong>This year, the
Mathematics Department collaborated with the Food and Consumer Education
(FCE) teachers to help students experience the relevance of mathematics
in everyday life. In groups, students used mathematical reasoning to complete
a recipe by calculating missing values, determining suitable serving sizes,
and suggesting healthier alternatives before preparing the dishes themselves.
The fun and meaningful project has enabled students to apply concepts such
as ratio, proportion, percentage, and unit conversion, while discovering
the interconnectedness of knowledge. Through this collaboration, students
strengthened their identity as confident, adaptable learners and built
a sense of community through shared passion and teamwork.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Stretching minds beyond the curriculum</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our stretch programmes give students the chance to understand their unique
strengths and pursue their passions beyond the curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through experiences like the Math Modelling CnME Elective module and the
International Mathematical Modelling Challenge (IMMC), students solve real-world
problems, make decisions based on their ideas, collaborate with peers,
and grow as confident, self-aware learners—truly reflecting strength in
identity and passion in community.</p>

<p><strong>IMMC 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>The 2025 International Mathematical Modeling Challenge (IMMC) centered
on designing a fair and efficient game schedule for a Global Sports League
(GSL) with 20 teams. Teams were tasked with designing a fair schedule that
balanced travel and competition, while allowing for new teams to join the
league. Our team comprising four Sec 4 students clinched a Distinction
for their submission.&nbsp;</p>
