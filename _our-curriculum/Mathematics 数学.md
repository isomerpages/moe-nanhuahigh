<p><strong>Spark the Quest: Igniting Passion in Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>To spark students’ passion in learning, the Mathematics department crafted
diverse learning experiences for them at various levels. For instance,
Secondary Two students had the opportunity to apply their knowledge of
Trigonometry to find the width of a canal. As Secondary three students
collaborated with their peers to design experiments for testing congruent
triangles, they not only gained a deeper understanding of the concepts,
but also learned to embrace the mindset of a mathematician. Learning also
became more meaningful when Secondary Three students had the opportunity
to engage in an ICT-enabled game in which they acquired financial literacy
knowledge and reflected on their values and attitude.

<p><strong>Foster Growth: Stretching the Boundaries of Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>Believing in acquiring knowledge beyond the curriculum, selected Secondary
Three students participated in a project that gave them the opportunity
to see how mathematical modelling is applied in managing the pandemic.
After Dr Kiesha Prem from the Saw See Hock School of Public Health and
London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine had shared her expertise
with them, students conducted their research in public health and applied
what they had learnt in their project. Another group of students took on
the challenge in the International Mathematical Modelling Competition.
Through in-depth mathematical analysis, they proposed the “best” land-use
option after considering short- and long-term benefits and costs. The team
was awarded a Certificate of Merit for their commendable efforts.</p>
