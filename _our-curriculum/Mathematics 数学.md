<h4>Spark the Quest: Igniting Passion in Learning</h4><p>To spark students’ passion in learning, the Mathematics department crafted diverse learning experiences for them at various levels. For instance, Secondary Two students had the opportunity to apply their knowledge of Trigonometry to find the width of a canal.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Our Curriculum/Math Dept/Canal_learning.jpg"></div><p>^With this measurement, we can apply the trigonometric ratio to find the width of the canal</p><p>As Secondary three students collaborated with their peers to design experiments for testing congruent triangles, they not only gained a deeper understanding of the concepts, but also learned to embrace the mindset of a mathematician. Learning also became more meaningful when Secondary Three students had the opportunity to engage in an ICT-enabled game in which they acquired financial literacy knowledge and reflected on their values and attitude.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Our Curriculum/Math Dept/vr.jpg"></div><p>^Visualising the rate of water flow through a VR app</p><h4>Foster Growth: Stretching the Boundaries of Learning</h4><p>Believing in acquiring knowledge beyond the curriculum, selected Secondary Three students participated in a project that gave them the opportunity to see how mathematical modelling is applied in managing the pandemic. After Dr Kiesha Prem from the Saw See Hock School of Public Health and London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine had shared her expertise with them, students conducted their research in public health and applied what they had learnt in their project.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Our Curriculum/Math Dept/Learning_from_Dr_Kiesha_Prem.jpg"></div><p>^ Learning from Dr Kiesha Prem</p><p>Another group of students took on the challenge in the International Mathematical Modelling Competition. Through in-depth mathematical analysis, they proposed the “best” land-use option after considering short- and long-term benefits and costs. The team was awarded a Certificate of Merit for their commendable efforts.</p><p></p><h4>Positive Accomplishments:</h4><p><strong>Singapore Mathematical Olympiad 2023</strong></p><ul><li><p>School Award Category 1: Silver</p></li><li><p>Junior - 1 Silver, 5 Bronze</p></li><li><p>Senior - 5 Bronze</p></li></ul><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Our Curriculum/Math Dept/olympiad2023.jpg"></div><p><strong>&nbsp;International Mathematical Modelling Competition 2023 -</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;Merit</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Our Curriculum/Math Dept/immc.jpg"></div><p></p><p></p>
