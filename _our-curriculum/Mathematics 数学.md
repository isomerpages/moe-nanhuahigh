<p><strong><u>Enhancing Learning through Mathematical Exploration</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Mathematics Department is committed to providing opportunities for
our students to engage in real-world problem-solving through mathematics.
These experiences seek to help students develop 21<sup>st</sup> Century
Competencies as they learn mathematical concepts in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>The following are some examples of what the students experienced. In June,
the Secondary One students embarked on a mini project to investigate the
rate of mould growth on bread. The project not only enabled students to
apply mathematical concepts such as percentage, rate and graphs, but also
helped them to appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of knowledge which
requires them to draw on multiple disciplines to solve complex problems.</p>

<p>Adopting a constructivist learning approach, the teachers gave Secondary
Two students a set of numbers and challenged them to decide on a number
that best represents each class, leading them to discover for themselves
the meaning of mean, mode and median’.</p>

<p>On a lighter note, the Secondary Three students had fun re-enacting a
scene from the familiar story of ‘Rapunzel and the Prince’ while learning
the concept of angle of depression in trigonometry.</p>

<p><strong><u>Embracing Challenges in Mathematical Exploration</u></strong>
</p>
<p>This year, our students continued to challenge themselves by participating
in national competitions which required them to apply their knowledge in
creative and practical ways.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>International Mathematical Modelling Challenge (IMMC)</strong>
</p>
<p>A team of four Secondary Four students — Pang Chen Zhe Ashten, Wang Ziqing,
Yu Huajun, and Long Yu Yang — participated in the International Mathematical
Modeling Challenge (IMMC). Using mathematical models, they explored the
suitability of households for pet ownership, taking into account factors
such as living conditions, financial considerations, and lifestyle. This
valuable experience provided students with the opportunity to tackle real-world
issues through the lens of mathematics. The team’s efforts earned them
a Merit Award.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore International Mathematical and Computational Challenge (SIMCC)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Secondary 3 students — Johan Lim, Guo Chengxi, and Victor Lim — took
part in the inaugural Singapore International Mathematical and Computational
Challenge (SIMCC 2.0), which provided a platform to utilise artificial
intelligence to address community issues. The team worked on measuring
the mental well-being of secondary school students and presented a thoughtful
solution to strengthen students’ mental health. The team also gained invaluable
insights into how technology and mathematics can come together to create
positive change. For their informative, clear and confident presentation,
the team received the Best Presentation Award.</p>

<p><strong>Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO) 2024</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>School Awards (Category 1): Bronze Award</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Junior Section: 5 Silver and 3 Bronze</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Senior Section: 1 Gold, 3 Silver and 3 Bronze</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these opportunities, our students are not only challenged but
also inspired to think critically and apply their learning in meaningful
ways. We are proud of their growth and hope that they will continue to
ride the waves of learning as they pursue their dreams.</p>
