<p>Physical Education plays a vital role in the overall development and well-being
of students, promoting physical fitness, instilling discipline, and fostering
teamwork. At Nan Hua High School, the PE department aims to cultivate confident
Nanhuarians who are motivated to find joy and fulfillment in pursuing a
lifelong active and healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>The team embraced a holistic approach to physical fitness, recognising
that it encompasses more than just physical prowess. A comprehensive curriculum
that focuses not only on skill development but also on fostering mental
resilience, emotional well-being, and social interaction helps students
develop a well-rounded understanding of physical fitness as a lifelong
pursuit.

<p><strong><em>Working together as a team</em></strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>By offering a wide array of programmes including team sports, individual
sports, and recreational activities, the team aims to ignite a passion
for sports among students. From territorial-invasion games to net-barrier
games, and striking and fielding games, we ensure that every student can
find their niche and explore their talents.</p>
<p>The PE department firmly believes in the importance of instilling values
such as sportsmanship, fair play, and respect in students. Activities are
deliberately crafted for students to learn valuable life lessons such as
accepting defeat graciously, celebrating victories humbly, and supporting
teammates through adversity.</p>

</p>
<p>Proactive steps were also taken by the team to engage staff in adopting
a healthy lifestyle. Leveraging on the LeAPS sessions carved out for physical
activity, a series of initiatives such as introducing different categories
of sports through play, organising the School-based Sports for Life Fitness
Assessment and carrying out mass physical workout were completed under
the Sweat It Out! programme. These efforts fostered a culture of health,
promoting not only physical well-being but also camaraderie among staff
members.</p>

<p><strong>Annual Road Run</strong>
</p>
<p>This event has become a cherished tradition that brings people together
in a shared pursuit of health, challenge, and fun. Commonly held at West
Coast Park, the event is more than just a race, as runners of various skill
levels lace up their running shoes to push their boundaries and achieve
personal goals. Beyond the physical aspect, the event promotes a sense
of togetherness among students and staff as they also engage in a healthy
picnic and a fun sports challenge as a fringe activity.</p>

<p><strong>Healthy Habits Sports Carnival</strong>
</p>
<p>Held at the end of semester 1, the sports carnival is a vibrant spectacle
that unites students in a celebration of athleticism and teamwork. Bursting
with colour and energy, a variety of activities were offered with students
showcasing their prowess and dedication. While the lower secondary cohorts
engaged in sprint relays and captain’s ball, the upper secondary students
were involved in recreational games such as Kin-ball, futsal and frisbee.
Supporters cheer for their peers with enthusiasm and offer words of encouragement,
adding to the electric atmosphere. The camaraderie and healthy competition
fostered during the carnival promote not only physical fitness but also
a sense of community.</p>
