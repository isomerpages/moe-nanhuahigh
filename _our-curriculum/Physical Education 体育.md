<p>Through sports, movement and wellness, the PE department aims to cultivate
confident Nanhuarians who are motivated to find joy and fulfillment in
pursuing a lifelong active and healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>PE goes beyond athletic skills - it builds physical literacy, resilience
and character. Through diverse individual and team sports, fitness and
outdoor activities, students gain discipline, confidence and a stronger
sense of identity during their formative years.</p>
<p>By leading warm-ups, managing team dynamics and reflecting on their performance,
students become self-directed learners, embracing both success and failure
as part of growth. This autonomy builds confidence that extends beyond
sports.</p>
<p>Our PE lessons are designed to be inclusive, encouraging every student,
regardless of skill level, to participate with enthusiasm and integrity.
Team sports like floorball, volleyball and softball, foster camaraderie
and deepen the bonds among classmates, creating a safe and supportive space
where students feel seen, heard and valued.</p>
<p>Beyond lessons, school-wide sporting events such as the Annual Road Run,
Healthy Habits Sports Carnival and <em>Game On!</em> are key highlights that
ignite school spirit by reinforcing the value of teamwork and fostering
a strong sense of community. The <em>Sweat It Out!</em> programme also had
staff engaging in physical activities, making them role models of active
living. Through collaboration and healthy competition, students and staff
experience first-hand the joy of being part of a passionate and united
community.</p>
<p>As we embrace the theme “<em>Strength in Identity, Passion in Community</em>”,
we celebrate every Nanhuarian’s journey - finding strength through movement
and building lasting friendships through sport. In PE, we nurture both
body and spirit, empowering our students to carry the school values and
vision with pride - from the playing field to the world beyond.</p>

<p><strong>Annual Road Run</strong>
</p>
<p>The Annual Road Run, held on 14 March 2025 at West Coast Park, brought
together students and staff for a day of fun, fitness, and bonding. Under
bright and sunny skies, all participants tackled the 3.2km route with determination,
cheered on by one another. Having trained for the run throughout Term 1,
this culminating event promoted resilience, perseverance, and a spirit
of healthy competition.</p>
<p>After the run, the Inter-Level Challenge added excitement through team-based
telematch games. It was such a roaring success that one would not have
been able to guess that it was the first time that students themselves
planned, organised and executed this segment. The preparation work that
went behind the scenes showcased the students’ creativity and determination
to make it fun for everyone. During the friendly competition, students
and staff displayed strong teamwork, sportsmanship, and encouragement for
one another, reflecting the value of unity and mutual respect.</p>

<p>Classes later gathered for a healthy picnic, where they relaxed, shared
stories, and strengthened friendships beyond the classroom. The event concluded
with a prize presentation to honour top performers, recognising their effort
and achievement.</p>
<p>The Road Run was more than just a physical challenge - it was a meaningful
experience that celebrated fitness, friendship, and school spirit. It left
everyone looking forward to the next one.</p>

<p><strong>Healthy Habits Sports Carnival</strong>
</p>
<p>The Healthy Habits Sports Carnival was a vibrant celebration of teamwork,
resilience, and school spirit. Lower secondary students kicked off the
day with exciting track activities and tele-matches, cheering each other
on and building strong bonds within their classes. Meanwhile, upper secondary
students showcased their skills and sportsmanship in interclass games of
Football, Frisbee, and Kinball, competing fiercely yet respectfully.</p>

<p>Through shared challenges and victories, participants learned the importance
of resilience, perseverance, and striving for excellence - values that
extend far beyond the sports field. The carnival provided a wonderful opportunity
for students to form new friendships, support one another, and experience
the joy of healthy living together.</p>

<p><strong>Sweat It Out!</strong>
</p>
<p>Throughout the year, staff took part in a vibrant and engaging sports
programme designed to promote wellness, camaraderie, and a strong sense
of school spirit. Staff were grouped into four teams, creating opportunities
for friendly competition and teamwork across departments and levels of
experience and expertise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The programme featured a wide range of sports and activities, from classic
games like Captain’s Ball and Badminton to new experiences such as Goalball,
which challenged participants to step out of their comfort zones and build
empathy through inclusive play. These shared experiences encouraged mutual
support, resilience, and a healthy competitive spirit.</p>

<p>More than just physical activity, the programme fostered stronger bonds
among staff, creating space for collaboration, laughter, and lasting memories.</p>
<p>By coming together through sport, staff demonstrated strength in identity
- proudly representing their teams - and passion in community, as they
supported one another and contributed to a vibrant, united school culture.</p>
