<p>Physical Education plays a vital role in the overall development and well-being
of students, promoting physical fitness, instilling discipline, and fostering
teamwork. At Nan Hua High School, the PE department has consistently nurtured
a culture of active living and sporting excellence among students and staff.</p>
<p>The team embraced a holistic approach to physical fitness, recognising
that it encompasses more than just physical prowess. A comprehensive curriculum
that focuses not only on skill development but also on fostering mental
resilience, emotional well-being, and social interaction helps students
develop a well-rounded understanding of physical fitness as a lifelong
pursuit.</p>
<p>By offering a wide array of programmes including team sports, individual
sports, and recreational activities, the team aims to ignite a passion
for sports among students. From territorial-invasion games to net-barrier
games, and striking and fielding games, we ensure that every student can
find their niche and explore their talents.</p>
<p>The PE department firmly believes in the importance of instilling values
such as sportsmanship, fair play, and respect in students. Activities are
deliberately crafted for students to learn valuable life lessons such as
accepting defeat graciously, celebrating victories humbly, and supporting
teammates through adversity.</p>
<p>Proactive steps were also taken by the team to engage staff in adopting
a healthy lifestyle. Leveraging on the LeAPS sessions carved out for physical
activity, a series of initiatives such as introducing different categories
of sports through play, organising the School-based Sports for Life Fitness
Assessment and carrying out mass physical workout were completed under
the Sweat It Out! programme. These efforts fostered a culture of health,
promoting not only physical well-being but also camaraderie among staff
members.</p>
<p><strong>Annual Road Run</strong>
</p>
<p>Marking the first mass sporting event at an external venue since recovering
from the grip of Covid-19, Nanhuarians gathered at West Coast Park for
the anticipated Annual Road Run. This event has become a cherished tradition
that brings people together in a shared pursuit of health, challenge, and
fun. The event is more than just a race, as runners of various skill levels
lace up their running shoes to push their boundaries and achieve personal
goals. Beyond the physical aspect, the event promotes a sense of togetherness
among students and staff as they also engage in a healthy picnic and a
fun sports challenge as a fringe activity.</p>
<p><strong>Healthy Habits Sports Carnival</strong>
</p>
<p>The Healthy Habit Sports Carnival is a vibrant spectacle that unites students
in a celebration of athleticism and teamwork. Bursting with colour and
energy, a variety of activities were offered with students showcasing their
prowess and dedication. While the lower secondary cohorts engaged in Captain’s
Ball and sprint relays, the upper secondary students were involved in a
multi-disciplinary sport challenge organised by Sports CCA leaders and
recreational games such as Kinball and inline skating. Supporters cheer
for their peers with enthusiasm and offer words of encouragement, adding
to the electric atmosphere. The camaraderie and healthy competition fostered
during the carnival promote not only physical fitness but also a sense
of community.</p>
