Enriching the learning experiences of students amidst the pandemic 2020 started with the Mathematics Department embarking on a journey to enhance student engagement so as to bring about joy of learning. We made the effort to provide learning experiences that could also deepen students’ understanding of mathematical concepts. Although the progress was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we worked at overcoming the new challenges through designing lessons that incorporated videos, games and quizzes, and promoted online interaction. We also tapped on Google Classroom to monitor students’ work and tools like the Padlet application to encourage students to learn independently. In the process, there was rich learning for everyone as we discovered the possibilities that the various platforms had opened up to us.

**Sec 3 CnME Modules**

(i)        Undoing Common Sense through Mathematical Thinking

Through this module, students had the opportunity to work on counter-intuitive problems, and learn the mathematical concepts and logical reasoning behind problems. One of the highlights of the module was when students had a chance to play the well-known “Monty Hall Game Show” and used the concepts in Probability to increase their chances at winning the game. It was a unique experience for all.

(ii)        Seeing the World through Mathematics

 In this module, students learnt how to gather data, construct mathematical models and applied their learning to scenarios such as the minimisation of travelling time and obtaining the height of a "criminal" just from a handprint. These culminated in a project which gave students the autonomy to research on a topic of their interest. This year, we embarked on investigations of interesting topics ranging from designing the ideal classroom seating arrangement to the evaluation of the “best” bubble tea. Students gained new insights about the application of Mathematics in the real world and also new perspectives.

**Math and Science Week 2021**   

    To inspire students to explore principles of Mathematics and Science embedded in real-life, and be discerning about information presented, the theme "Quare", which means "Why?" in Latin, was chosen this year.

    During the Assembly programme, students explored misconceptions and paradoxes. Some intriguing misconceptions and paradoxes include bullets that can curve (a misconception especially prevalent in Hollywood films), and the Birthday Paradox. The programme culminated in an online Escape Room activity, where students collaborated with their peers to solve challenging Mathematics and Science questions.

Excel Programme

Appreciating the usefulness of Mathematics in real life is a goal of Mathematics education. Through our Excel Programme “Seeing the World through Mathematics”, students who demonstrate an aptitude for in-depth study of the subject could engage in mathematical modelling. The department also aspires to help students develop a sense of positive accomplishment through opportunities to participate in the International Mathematical Modelling Competition and Singapore Mathematical Society's Essay Competition in which students conducted mathematical analysis of the current pandemic situation. In the process, students learnt to appreciate the subject at a deeper level, thereby igniting their passion for learning.
