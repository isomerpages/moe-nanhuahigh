<p><strong>STEM Endeavors</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>STEM Playground Challenge organized by CPDD, Science Centre and The James Dyson Foundation</strong>
<br>Organised by the James Dyson Foundation, Science Centre Singapore and
the Ministry of Education (CPDD). The aim of the STEM challenges is to
encourage and develop students’ interest, curiosity, and creativity. To
enable this, opportunities were created for all students to participate
in the challenge during curriculum time. As students immerse in the world
of discovery, they demonstrated their creativity and critical thinking
while igniting a passion for scientific exploration. Students had the chance
to turn everyday things into extraordinary creations. They got to experiment
with their ideas to continually enhance them, which is the spirit and essence
of STEM! We are proud to announce that Nan Hua High School has won 1<sup>st</sup> Prize
(Secondary) in STEM Playground Challenge 1!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>STEM Workshop led by Dr Tan Aik Ling (National Institute of Education)</strong>
</p>
<p>Since 2022, the Science Department has embarked on our journey to spearhead
STEM-related activities in the school for both staff and students. We had
the privilege of attending a STEM workshop conducted by the eminent Dr
Tan Aik Ling from the National Institute of Education in September this
year. Dr Tan demonstrated, using an engaging activity in which participants
examined the causes of water shortage and how to design an innovative solution
using 21st Century Skills. The workshop also showed how the Science curriculum
can be infused with STEM activities to engender engagement in real world
issues, multiple perspectives through role play as well as an appreciation
for how STEM is a part of everyday living.</p>

<p>Selected teachers from the Science Department attended the inaugural International
STEM Education Conference from 26 to 28 June. At the conference, the teachers
presented about Nan Hua’s commitment towards a whole-school approach in
integrating STEM across the curriculum to enhance students’ 21st century
competencies and develop their ways of thinking and doing science. Through
meaningful conversations with educators from all over the world, the teachers
gained useful insights into the development of STEM education in different
countries, which underscores the transformative impact of embedding STEM
deeply into our educational practices.&nbsp;</p>
