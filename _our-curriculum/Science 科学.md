**Department's focus towards STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) Program**

The Science department has engaged the professional guidance of Dr Tan Aik Ling to conduct STEM workshops and consultations for our teachers to deepen their understanding on STEM. Dr Tan is the Deputy Head (Teaching and Curriculum Matters) and Associate Professor of Natural Sciences and Science Education at the National Institute of Education. Putting our learning into practice, we designed STEM PLC projects for our upper secondary Chemistry and Biology students. The students took part in challenges to design the best sleeve for hot and cold drinks, and to design innovative, sustainable solutions to improve crop yield through vertical farming. As part of the PLC project, some of our students also took part in the nation-wide STEM Playground 2022 competition to design balloon cars and geodesic domes, creating prize-winning designs.


**Enrichment Programs**  

Our students were offered opportunities to take part in many competitions. Here are some of the highlights and achievements:

1\. Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad 2022 (Awarded 13 individual and 3 team awards)

Students collaborated on challenging Physics problems.
  

2\. ACJC International Biomedical Quiz 
(Awarded 1 Gold, 4 Silver, 4 Bronze)

Students went through a series of online workshops on Oncology and applied their learning to real life clinical contexts.
