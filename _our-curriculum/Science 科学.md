<p><strong>STEM Endeavors</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>STEM Playground Challenge organized by CPDD, Science Centre and The James Dyson Foundation</strong>
<br>Organised by the James Dyson Foundation, Science Centre Singapore and
the Ministry of Education (CPDD). The aim of the STEM challenges is to
encourage and develop students’ interest, curiosity, and creativity. To
enable this, opportunities were created for all students to participate
in the challenge during curriculum time. As students immerse in the world
of discovery, they demonstrated their creativity and critical thinking
while igniting a passion for scientific exploration. Students had the chance
to turn everyday things into extraordinary creations. They got to experiment
with their ideas to continually enhance them, which is the spirit and essence
of STEM!</p>
<p>Our school clinched 1st place at the national level in both 2025 STEM
Playground Challenge 1 &amp; 2. This exciting initiative inspires students
to tackle real-world problems through creative, hands-on STEM exploration.</p>
<p>In Challenge 1, <em>“A pH-antom Ship!”</em>, participants designed boats
made from recycled bottles, powered by chemical reactions — blending chemistry,
physics, and design in one thrilling task. Challenge 2, <em>“Slow Descent Helicopter!”</em>,
pushed teams to craft a paper-and-paperclip helicopter that glides gracefully
from the second storey, testing their grasp of gravity and engineering.</p>
<p>Both challenges celebrated creativity, teamwork, and innovation, showing
how curiosity and STEM concepts can come alive through fun, accessible,
and sustainable materials.</p>

<p><strong>Enrichment Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>Our students were offered opportunities to take part in many external
competitions to stretch their abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Singapore Junior Biology Olympiad (SJBO) 2025</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Junior Biology Olympiad (SJBO) 2025 is a prestigious national
competition that invites secondary school students to push their limits
and explore the wonders of biology beyond the classroom. Through thought-provoking
problem-solving and inquiry-based activities, students sharpen their analytical
skills and uncover how biology connects to real-world challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad (SJPO) 2025</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad (SJPO) is a prestigious national
competition that challenges secondary school students to apply their understanding
of Physics to complex and thought-provoking problems. This year, our students
demonstrated strong analytical and problem-solving skills, earning well-deserved
recognition for their efforts.</p>
<p><strong><u>Illustratum 2025</u></strong>
</p>
<p>This is a competition organised by NUS High School that invited local
students to showcase their science communication skills by presenting on
a Physics concept of their choice. The event aimed to inspire creativity,
clarity, and engagement in explaining complex scientific ideas to a broader
audience.</p>
<p>Representing the school, Zheng Yongjie Andy, Kendric Ong Jian Xun, and
Nga Jia Le from Class 401 participated in Illustrum with their project
titled “Surface Tension of Water.” Through detailed research, experimentation,
and clear presentation, the team demonstrated strong scientific understanding
and effective communication. Their dedication and teamwork were recognised
with a Distinction, reflecting their passion and excellence in Physics.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>International Competitions and Assessments for Schools (ICAS) - Science&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>ICAS provides an excellent opportunity for students to gain a measure
of their academic abilities in an international external assessment. This
year, our students achieved outstanding results.</p>
<p><strong><u>ACJC Science Quiz</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Anglo-Chinese Junior College (ACJC) Science Competition is an annual
event that provides secondary school students with the opportunity to apply
scientific concepts creatively and critically in real-world contexts. This
year, our students achieved commendable results, demonstrating both scientific
rigour and enthusiasm for inquiry-based learning. reflecting their solid
grasp of scientific concepts and perseverance.</p>
