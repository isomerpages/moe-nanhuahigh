<p><strong>Current Affairs and Structured Reading Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>One of the main programmes run by the ELL Department is the Current Affairs
and Structured Reading Programme. This year's Current Affairs Programme
delved into the theme “Us versus Them: Our changing relationship with animals”.
A thought-provoking hot seating session was held during the school's assembly
programme, featuring a diverse range of animals, including the unassuming
cockroach to the heartbreakingly extinct white rhinoceros. The impactful
presentations aimed to heighten students' awareness of our evolving connections
with creatures around us and the overwhelming response to the quiz reflected
the students' deepened understanding and concern for the welfare of animals
in our changing world. In addition, our Reading Ambassadors had introduced
a new genre to the school each month. They created library displays featuring
recommended texts and shared book reviews with their schoolmates. To encourage
reading, the Reading Ambassadors also launched the Golden Ticket Event!
An exciting hunt for golden tickets saw an increase in books being borrowed
from the library, where the winner had scavenged a whopping fourteen tickets!</p>

<p><strong>English and Humanities Week</strong>
</p>
<p>English and Humanities week, with the theme of “Artificial Intelligence”,
was a resounding success! The English Drama club’s performance on a futuristic
world with AI set the tone for the week, captivating both teachers and
students. Our mobile library delighted bookworms with award-winning AI-centric
tales, sparking new dimensions of storytelling. Crossword puzzles and word
searches added to the adrenaline rush as students explored the enigmatic
AI realm. Celebrating language triumphs and nurturing creativity, the week
inspired a love for words and ideas. Our English and Humanities week was
not just about exploration and imagination; it was also about celebrating
the success of our students as we commemorated their victories in the various
school-led competitions in the English language and Literature classrooms,
such as the inter-class Choral Competition, where students will read a
poem through creative expressions, and the Book Trailer Competition, where
students dramatise moments from our beloved plays.

<p><strong>National Schools' Literature Festival</strong>
</p>
<p>Nan Hua has always been an active participant in the bi-annual National
Schools' Literature Festival. This year, NSLF was held on 15 July over
online platforms. Our students took part in an astounding 5 events, Lower
Secondary Book Trailer, Lower Secondary Choral Reading, Upper Secondary
Unseen Debate, Flash Fiction Competition and Poetry Pitching. Our students
did us proud by attaining a variety of awards in the various events. Most
notably, Chia Hao Yang Kyle from 401 attained the Silver Award in the Flash
Fiction Competition. Poetry Pitching also saw two Secondary 4 students
role playing to discuss a given poem, their outstanding performance led
them to achieve two awards; “text expert award” and “engaging diplomat
award”. It was truly a day where we come together to celebrate Literature,
and reaffirm how intellectually stimulating and actively creative Literature
can be.</p>
