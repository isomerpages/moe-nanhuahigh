The English Language and Literature department stays committed to our mission of nurturing world-savvy, articulate and engaging students. This year, we leveraged on the experiences gained from facing the challenges brought about by the pandemic and transformed them into opportunities to further our mission, by synergising new pedagogical approaches to enhance existing techniques. On top of signature events such as the Secondary One Public Speaking Workshops held in Term 1, the Structured Reading Programme, and the Reading Ambassadors programme, the department continued its collaboration with the Humanities Department through an exciting EL-Humanities Week Assembly lesson in Term 3 that helped students appreciate English while learning about social issues. 

  

**Secondary 1 Public Speaking Competition**

  

With the aim of encouraging confident speakers, a Public Speaking Competition was organised for Secondary One students. The best speaker for each class competed against one another in two segments. Judges were impressed with the quality of the presentations especially for the impromptu speech segment. Congratulations to these winners of this competition!

In the Secondary Two Debate Competition, top speakers from each class were selected to represent their class in a face-to-face debate finally after much-awaited relaxation of safe distancing measures. After rounds of intense debate, the competition concluded with classes 203, 204, 207, 208 and 209 emerging victorious!

**Secondary 3 Inter-Class English Language Planned Response Competition**

On 15 July 2022, a representative from each Sec 3 class took part in the competition, where participants had to prepare Planned Responses to a range of topics from e-sports to cyberbullying. After an intensive and insightful round, Kim Harim of 305 emerged as Champion!

Nan Hua Orators is home to students with a passion for public speaking in the English Language. Orators have a chance to not only showcase their oratorical skills but also develop their confidence, resilience and teamwork. A highlight of the programme is Nan Hua Speaks, a fortnightly presentation programme, where students share topics of interest with their school mates. The orators also serve as emcees for school events and take part in public speaking competitions. This year, Teo Laura of 104 made it into the YMCA Plain English Speaking Award 
Semi-Finals, and Myra Lim Zhuo En of 206 and Kim Harim of 305 emerged Grand-Finalists of the National Public Speaking Competition!

The Structured Reading Programme and Current Affairs Programme aims to cultivate good reading habits among students while heightening their awareness of current affairs. 

This year, our Reading Ambassadors took the lead by sharing their book reviews with their schoolmates on the English Language and Literature website. During the school’s assembly programme, they also explored topics that are of interest to them such as youth empowerment and the changing employment landscape. The Reading Ambassadors will strive to encourage their peers to continue reading by sparking their interest in reading. 

  
“I was excited to post the book review I designed and wrote on the SRP website! Knowing that my fellow schoolmates would read this was really exciting to me. It makes me happy knowing that a book that I enjoy might also be similarly loved by my schoolmates!” 

Chua Yee Ting, 304

Literites, Geographites and Historianites unite!

The English Language and Humanities Week (EL-HUM Week) returned to the hall this year with a highly interactive performance by the English Drama and Debate Club. The theme for this year was ‘Alternative Realities’, which brought Nanhuarians through different worlds to discover the importance of each and every one of our Humanities and English language and Literature subjects. Nanhuarians also got the chance to go on eye-opening learning journeys to Battle Box and LTA Mobility Gallery. Coupled with a special English lesson and EL-HUM quiz, Nanhuarians enjoyed a week full of enriching activities.
