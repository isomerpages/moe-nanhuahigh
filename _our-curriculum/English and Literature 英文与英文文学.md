<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>The English Language and Literature department is committed to our mission
to promote the effective use and appreciation of English Language and Literature.
We believe that through the dedication of our teachers and our key programmes,
we will be able to cultivate world-savvy, articulate, and engaging students
who will thrive amidst the challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p><strong><u>Current Affairs and Structured Reading Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>One of the main programmes run by the ELL Department is the Current Affairs
and Structured Reading Programme. This year's Current Affairs Programme
delved into the various unique career choices, inviting students to remain
open-minded to different career choices.</p>
<p>The impactful videos and group discussions heightened students' awareness
of evolving definitions of success, as well as the struggles and challenges
pioneering youths have had to overcome in pursuing their dreams.</p>
<p>In addition, the Reading Ambassadors introduced a new genre to the school
each month. They decorated library displays and shared book reviews with
their schoolmates. To encourage reading, the Reading Ambassadors also ran
events such as A Blind Date with a Book, where students participated in
a personality quiz and were recommended books based on the results. The
ambassadors also encouraged the students to enthusiastically support National
Library Board’s (NLB) Read for Books charity drive by organising reading
sessions in the school library as well as a mass reading session. For every
10 people who read for 15 minutes, one book or equivalent would be donated
to selected beneficiaries identified by the NLB.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>English and Humanities Week</u></strong>
</p>
<p>This year’s English and Humanities week, with the theme of “Games”, was
a resounding success! The English Drama Club kicked off the week with an
engaging skit depicting a fictional kingdom ruled by game characters. In
class, students were introduced to the history of language-based games,
and competed against their classmates in Quordle. At recess breaks, students
were treated to a plethora of language-based games that further demonstrated
the creative potential of the English Language, igniting their love for
the language. Our English and Humanities week was not just about exploration
and imagination; it also celebrated the success of our students as we acknowledged
their victories in various level competitions in the English language and
Literature classrooms.</p>

<p><strong><u>Level Competitions and Nanhua Orators</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Level Competitions and Nanhua Orators provide avenues for students
to further hone their mastery of the language.</p>
<p>The secondary one level participated in an elevator pitch competition
where contestants proposed ideas for how a space in school could be reimagined
to enhance learning experiences. They presented their ideas confidently
to the principal, Mr Chiew, and were adaptive and inventive when responding
to his queries and counter-proposals.</p>
<p>The secondary two level participated in interclass debates on contemporary
issues. Adopting a discerning lens, they conducted thorough research and
learnt to view an issue from multiple perspectives. During the debates,
they presented their ideas with assertiveness, and responded nimbly to
opposing views. The students also participated in a Book Trailer Competition,
where they directed and performed a trailer on their literature text—The
Merchant of Venice. They tapped on their rich understanding of the text
in selecting key scenes of intrigue and expressed their creativity in their
witty portrayal of those scenes.</p>
<p>The secondary three students participated in an impromptu speech competition,
demonstrating adaptive thinking, exceptional eloquence and excellent communication
skills to deliver their ideas with finesse.</p>
<p>Finally, Nanhua Orators gave aspiring orators a platform to hone their
public speaking skills through fortnightly morning assemblies during Nan
Hua Speaks. Some took the challenge further, participating in inter-school
competitions such as the National Public Speaking Competition.&nbsp;</p>
