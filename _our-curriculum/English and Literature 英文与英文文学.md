<p>At the core of Nan Hua High School’s English Language and Literature department
is the unwavering commitment to our mission: to promote the effective use
and appreciation of English Language and Literature. With dedicated teachers
at the helm of our signature programmes, we strive to cultivate world-savvy,
articulate, and compassionate students who will thrive in an everchanging
21<sup>st</sup> century.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Structured Reading Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Nan Hua’s Structured Reading Programme encourages students who love reading
to share their passion with their peers. As part of this programme, our
Reading Ambassadors collaborated across levels to present ‘Genre of the
Month’ – an initiative where students are introduced to new genres of books
monthly. From engaging morning announcements, creative infographics on
the programme website, a carefully curated list of book recommendations
to a book display in the school library, our Reading Ambassadors pulled
out all the stops to get their peers reading.</p>
<p>The Secondary 3 Reading Ambassadors also led a schoolwide 15-minute reading
session after morning assembly as part of the National Library Board’s
“Read for Books” charity drive. Through this collective effort, the school
raised a total of 252 books for beneficiaries. They also initiated an interclass
reading competition, where classes competed to accumulate the most leisure-reading
hours. Eventually, 102, 208, 302 and 401 emerged victorious.</p>
<p><strong>Nanhua Orators</strong>
</p>
<p>Nanhua Orators offers a platform for students to cultivate their public
speaking skills through regular sessions during Nan Hua Speaks. Through
opportunities such as serving as Open House student ambassadors and participating
in national competitions like the National Public Speaking Competition,
students develop exceptional communication abilities. Students demonstrated
strength in shaping their orator identity while instilling passion for
community involvement.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Interdisciplinary Week</strong>
</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary Week celebrated the spirit of connected learning through
exciting recess activities. Students guessed National Day songs, explored
cultural and scientific ideas in the Solstice Challenge, and discovered
how subjects intertwine in meaningful ways. The week highlighted curiosity,
creativity, and collaboration as students experienced firsthand how learning
can extend beyond classrooms.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Learning Journey – Shakespeare in the Park</strong>
</p>
<p>The learning journey to Shakespeare in the Park is a much-anticipated
part of our Literature department’s mission to cultivate a deeper appreciation
for the subject. A total of 131 Upper Secondary Literature students, selected
Secondary Two students, and English Drama and Debate Club students had
a blast under the stars as they watched the Singapore Repertory Theatre’s
production of Shakespeare’s “Macbeth”.</p>
<p><strong>Level Programmes (English Language)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Secondary One students participated in a Public Speaking workshop
this year. Over a few sessions, students had the opportunity to hone their
communication skills through engaging activities set in different contexts.
The best speakers from every class also participated in an ‘Elevator Pitch’
competition, proposing ideas on creating a more inclusive school environment.
Students put their newly learnt skills into practice as they took a leisurely
walk around the Bi-cultural Garden with our Vice-principal, Ms Tay!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The English Language and Literature (ELL) Masterclass is a stretch programme
for Secondary Four students, focusing on key areas like essay writing,
spoken interaction, and literary devices. With topics such as thesis refinement
and impactful conclusions, along with insights from expert trainers, the
programme equips students to excel in their upcoming national examinations.</p>

<p><strong>Level Programmes (Literature)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Secondary 1 Choral Speaking Competition is an inter-class competition
that aims to help students understand the themes of kindness and diversity
in the novel ‘Wonder’ by R.J Palacio. Students take on the roles of the
characters and the narrator to emotively express the inner workings of
each character while appreciating varying perspectives and extending empathy.</p>

<p>The Secondary 2 Book Trailer invites groups of Secondary Two students
to reimagine Shakespeare’s ‘Merchant of Venice’ into a modern and localised
trailer, with the purpose of engaging students to creatively adapt their
learning into an engaging performance. The winning group would later go
on to participate in the National School Literature Festival (NSLF), as
part of the Book Trailer competition.&nbsp;</p>

<br>The National Schools Literature Festival (NSLF) Secondary 3 Unseen Poetry
Debate has long been an enriching and fun way for our Literature students
to pit their proficiency at close-reading a poem against that of their
peers’ in other schools. This year, a team of four Nanhuarians, Megan Toh
Jing En and Wang Hui’en Carissa from 303, and Allison Oak Soe Trixie Koh
Yuxi from 304 debated against the team from Chung Cheng High School (main)
and emerged as the winner!&nbsp;</p>
