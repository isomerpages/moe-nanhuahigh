**EL-Humanities Week**  

The aim of the EL-Humanities week is to highlight to students the relevance of the English Language and Humanities subjects in their daily lives, while inculcating the joy of learning. This year, the theme “Conserving our Heritage, Feeding our Future” highlights the rich food heritage of Singapore while raising students’ awareness of contemporary issues relating to the topic of food. Through the various activities that integrate skills taught by both the English Language and Humanities subjects, students exercised autonomy through critical thinking and developed empathy by making decisions while standing in the shoes of their characters, Max and Bee Lian. Students actively shaped the characters’ destiny, making choices for and guiding them through the most pressing issues relating to the topic of food in Singapore.  
  
  

“I learnt about key historical events. The activities were engaging. We had to edit a letter, and solve riddles based on a map. My favourite part was being given a choice to vote which path David should take through Singapore’s tumultuous times.”

Tan Zhengkai, 106

**Geographical Investigation**

Geographical Investigation

  

Secondary One students were tasked to find out the effects of human activities on the quality of water in waterways. Although unable to carry out water testing, students tapped on technology to learn more about such impacts in a country of their choice. Students then articulated their opinions on the depth of such impacts of human activities on the natural environment.

**Historical Investigation**

Historical Investigation

Secondary One and Two students are tasked to research on a selected inquiry question as part of their Historical Investigation process each year. Through this process, students learn to critically analyse and unpack the inquiry question. After completing in-depth research and analysis, they share their findings and arrive at a collective response to the question.

 **H.S.I Challenge**

HSI 2020

The annual H.S.I Challenge, organised by the National Library, gives lower secondary students the opportunity to put their historical inquiry and information literacy skills to test. This year, students were tasked to create an infographic that illustrates one public health related incident or movement that Singapore had overcome from 1900 to 2000. A group of Secondary Two students tapped on skills acquired during History lessons to gather information from trusted sources and created an infographic on Singapore’s anti-drug movement.

Presentation of our ideas

**Social Media and Marketing**  

“The NH Social Media Marketing module taught me how to improve my presentations through the use of statistics and appropriate media. I also learnt how to ‘declutter my presentations and make them palatable. Through this module, I now know how to make the audience more interested in my presentation.”  

Ju Yuan Xin, Charlene, 303 

**Bringing people back from the past**

  

“I learnt how to speak with more confidence and fluency.  I can also apply what I have learnt into my Exco speeches for my CCA. At the same time, I now believe that Singapore can advance even more in the future years and do even better than before.”

Liu Yutong, 304

**NUS Geography Challenge**

“From the Sec 3 CnME module on NUS Geography Challenge, I’m now more aware of the causes of and possible solutions to climate change. We were able to take part in fun activities and present our ideas in our groups. This course has definitely enriched me!”

**New Town Secondary - Nan Hua High School Social Studies Issues Investigation Collaboration 2021**  
  
    The inaugural NTSS-NHHS issues investigation collaboration provided Nan Hua students with the opportunity to experience social mixing while maintaining safe management measures enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. It allowed students to work with others of different backgrounds and encouraged them to step out of their comfort zone, to learn the importance of communication and teamwork.

											 Presenting our findings over Zoom

  

    With their New Town Secondary School counterparts, they embarked on a journey to investigate contemporary social issues Singapore faces today. Together, they gathered data and analysed their results, and reflected on the implications of their findings. This experience culminated in a final presentation over Zoom where students presented their findings and proposed recommendations to their peers and teachers.
