**Department's focus towards STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) Program**

The Science department has engaged the professional guidance of Dr Tan Aik Ling to conduct STEM workshops and consultations for our teachers to deepen their understanding on STEM. Dr Tan is the Deputy Head (Teaching and Curriculum Matters) and Associate Professor of Natural Sciences and Science Education at the National Institute of Education. Putting our learning into practice, we designed STEM PLC projects for our upper secondary Chemistry and Biology students. The students took part in challenges to design the best sleeve for hot and cold drinks, and to design innovative, sustainable solutions to improve crop yield through vertical farming. As part of the PLC project, some of our students also took part in the nation-wide STEM Playground 2022 competition to design balloon cars and geodesic domes, creating prize-winning designs.


**Enrichment Programs**  

Our students were offered opportunities to take part in many competitions. Here are some of the highlights and achievements:

1\. Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad 2022  
     (Awarded 13 individual and 3 team awards)

    Students collaborated on challenging Physics problems.
  

2\. ACJC International Biomedical Quiz    
     (1 Gold, 4 Silver, 4 Bronze)

    Students went through a series of online workshops on Oncology and applied their learning to real life clinical contexts.

The IS assignment gave me the opportunity to create a game that can raise awareness about the ways in which people can protect the environment in the long run. I was challenged to think creatively to design aesthetically pleasing game cards and also to create different scenarios that can make my group’s game more sustainable in the long run so that people will remember what they can do to protect the environment.  

  

I also learnt the importance of teamwork where we respect and listen to each other’s opinion and acknowledge differing viewpoints. With strong teamwork, we came up with an amazing game which managed to combine all our ideas!”

Eng Yi Xuan Jazelle, 201

4\. STEM training with Dr Tan

    Echoing the nation’s call for promoting STEM education in the teaching of Science, and supporting the school in applying innovative pedagogical skills relevant for Science teaching and learning, the Science Department engaged Dr Tan Aik Ling, Deputy Head (Teaching and Curriculum Matters), Natural Sciences and Science Education (NSSE), NIE, to conduct a series of professional development for the Science teachers on integrating STEM education into Science lessons. Through the STEM education training, Science teachers shared how they have benefited from the PD sessions.

    “Dr Tan’s sharing has encouraged me to think deeper into the nature of socio-scientific issues and how to conduct classroom discussions to enhance scientific literacy and moral sensitivity in students. I also appreciate how I was able to develop my students’ Habits of Thinking and raise their awareness of how Science is related and applied to the world around them.” 

– Ms Sheena Ng, Chemistry Teacher

  
    “The sharing enlightened me on how STEM education relates closely to the different roles played by Science that is encapsulated in the Science Curriculum Framework.” 

– Mr Daniel Tan, Physics Teacher
