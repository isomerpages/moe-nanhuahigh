**Innovations in responding to a crisis**

It has been an extraordinary year for the Science department, in rising to meet the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the shift to Full HBL, many of us had to learn new tools, and adapt our teaching and feedback strategies within a very short span of time to connect with our students.  The department challenged ourselves to be innovative in our pedagogical practices and were truly encouraged by the progress we have made to evolve seamlessly into blended forms of Teaching and Learning. The Science Department  capitalised on the training provided by the ICT Committee to transform our teaching practices and maximise students’ learning experience for HBL. With the apt use of Google Apps, teachers gamified learning tasks. Students played Escape Room to solve problems on Kinematics to obtain codes that unlock the room. Videos created by the Chemistry teachers allowed students to continue learning practical skills at their own pace. Interactive Thinking tools on SLS and other online tools like Formative and Kahoot were also used to assess students’ learning and provide real-time feedback. For Biology, learning blood typing was made real when students experienced an online game-based learning from Nobel Prize Organisation Page to have a clear visualisation on concepts relating to blood.

“HBL was a completely new experience for us. One of the most interesting activities is the 'Escape Room' conducted by our Physics teacher. During the activity, we were locked in a basement, where we had to answer questions to retrieve a code that unlocks the door which brings us to the next platform, slowly leading us to the main door. We could choose our own groupings, so that we could get past the questions more easily. We were racing against time and this gave us a sense of competitiveness and was a test of our quick thinking. Despite restrictions during HBL, I have managed to learn new knowledge.”

Chau Wen Jian, 301

**Learning Experiences**  

Drawing on our collective experience and expertise, the Science Department has re-framed and re-scaled our planned programmes to continue to provide positive learning experiences for the students.

1\. Lower-secondary Science Curriculum

    The new Lower-secondary Science Curriculum introduced in 2021 seeks to enhance students’ understanding of the local and global challenges faced in the 21st century. To encourage the joy of learning Science, the Integrative Activity and Performance-based Assessment for Secondary 1 students were specially crafted to include guided inquiry and elements of scientific investigation.

Through the process of investigating real-world problems such as water pollution caused by soil erosion, students conducted research, brainstormed possible solutions and developed models to test their hypothesis before evaluating and communicating their findings.

**2\. Maths and Science Week 2021**  

    This year, the theme for Math and Science Week was ‘Quare’, the latin term for ‘how’ or ‘why’. In line with the spirit of curiosity, our school created a variety of interactive activities to inspire our students to explore how Math and Science is all around them. Through a sharing session by Associate Professor Tan Aik Ling from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore, our students discovered the importance of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education and how it is applicable to their daily lives. Our teachers also engaged students to participate in a myth-buster and online escape room activity, to pique their interest in developing skills to recognise and determine the reliability of information presented to them. Other exciting activities include our parachute challenge and soap-making workshop. Collectively, these activities aim to encourage our students to observe and understand the relevance of Math and Science in our daily lives.

 **3.** **Gamification as a pedagogy in Science**

In alignment with the school’s direction in exploring gamification as a pedagogical tool, the Science Department took up the challenge to design lessons integrating gamification principles in all three science disciplines, namely Physics, Chemistry and Biology.  

In the Sec 2 Integrated Science (IS) curriculum,  Game Design assignment was introduced to encourage students to apply Scientific and Environment Science knowledge to the real-world context. In the assignment, students were tasked to collaborate with their peers to design a game to create awareness about an environmental problem, the importance of protecting the environment or ways in which people can protect the environment. They were challenged to research different environmental issues and game plays before developing their team’s environment game, including designing their own game prototype and rules. Students’ creativity was put to test and they responded positively, producing several interesting and unique games.

The IS assignment gave me the opportunity to create a game that can raise awareness about the ways in which people can protect the environment in the long run. I was challenged to think creatively to design aesthetically pleasing game cards and also to create different scenarios that can make my group’s game more sustainable in the long run so that people will remember what they can do to protect the environment.  

  

I also learnt the importance of teamwork where we respect and listen to each other’s opinion and acknowledge differing viewpoints. With strong teamwork, we came up with an amazing game which managed to combine all our ideas!”

4\. STEM training with Dr Tan

    Echoing the nation’s call for promoting STEM education in the teaching of Science, and supporting the school in applying innovative pedagogical skills relevant for Science teaching and learning, the Science Department engaged Dr Tan Aik Ling, Deputy Head (Teaching and Curriculum Matters), Natural Sciences and Science Education (NSSE), NIE, to conduct a series of professional development for the Science teachers on integrating STEM education into Science lessons. Through the STEM education training, Science teachers shared how they have benefited from the PD sessions.

    “Dr Tan’s sharing has encouraged me to think deeper into the nature of socio-scientific issues and how to conduct classroom discussions to enhance scientific literacy and moral sensitivity in students. I also appreciate how I was able to develop my students’ Habits of Thinking and raise their awareness of how Science is related and applied to the world around them.” 

– Ms Sheena Ng, Chemistry Teacher

  
    “The sharing enlightened me on how STEM education relates closely to the different roles played by Science that is encapsulated in the Science Curriculum Framework.” 

– Mr Daniel Tan, Physics Teacher
