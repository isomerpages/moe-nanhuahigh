The Physical Education (PE) department continues to cultivate positive habits in students through a rigorous PE and Healthy Habits programme. Focusing on not just physical health, our collaboration with other departments and committees allows students to also be aware of their mental, emotional and social well-being to develop themselves holistically. With the opportunity to learn a variety of sports and games, and participate in a range of activities, students can become competent in and passionate about pursuing an active, healthy lifestyle. Students can also learn to work together as a team and nurture class spirit as they acquire the knowledge, skills, right attitudes and values to understand the importance of maintaining fitness for their personal well-being.

Â At the end of Term 1 and 2, students had the opportunity to engage in 2 days of level-wide activities, which further facilitated class-based and level-based bonding as they work together towards a common goal. Those were also days that students could destress and enjoy a fun-filled day of activities to celebrate the hard work they have put in throughout the term. Not forgetting the mental and affective domain, students also had sessions to show their gratitude and practice mindfulness as part of their holistic well-being development.
 
 At this event, Secondary 1 students participated in the inter-class recreational Captain's Ball competition, held at NUS High School of Mathematics and Science. The Secondary 2 students pitted their speed against one another in a track event at Clementi Stadium. This was the students' first opportunity since the relaxation of SMM guidelines to be able to interact with students from other classes in a sporting event. The enthusiasm from the students electrified the atmosphere as they fervently cheered their classmates on during the event. Creative signage designed by the students were also on full display at the grandstand, to motivate their classmates.
 
 "The 2022 Healthy Habits Sports Carnival was definitely the highlight of our Secondary 1 year and was very memorable for all of us! I recall many of my classmates cheering one another on by the sidelines and having lots of fun competing and playing for our class. Although there were disagreements between some of the classes, 108 emerged in 4th place. All in all, I'm sure many of us made fond memories and had a great time!"

 For the Secondary 3 cohort, the PE department came up with a modified version of "Family Feud" meets "Amazing Race", coining it as *Class Clash*. In this game, students harnessed their collaborative effort to excel in tasks creatively. An example was using their resources at hand in the classroom to build the longest structure. Many students exercised their creativity, incorporating unexpected items such as standing fans, brooms and old newspapers as part of their structure!
 
"In *Class Clash*, all of us worked together and were very supportive towards one another as classmates. Everyone did our part and leveraged on one another's strengths. We also trusted one another to give it our best and thus, we were able to achieve a positive result while at the same time building wonderful memories to look back upon."

The Secondary 4 students had the opportunity to engage in physical activities not offered in their PE programme, such as Kinball, Tchoukball, Archery Tag and martial arts. The objective was to expose them to various sports to pique their interest in pursuing an active lifestyle as they prepare to move on to the next stage of their education.

In addition, the PE department continues to hatch, hone and heighten healthy habits in staff by enhancing staff health, well-being and satisfaction through consistent and manageable healthy lifestyle pursuits. Leveraging on the PACER app, fun challenges such as virtual adventure challenges and step challenges were set up through the app to encourgae staff to stay active and virtually travel the world together. Through these efforts, staff can model the way for their students, and highlight the importance of staying active and healthy.
