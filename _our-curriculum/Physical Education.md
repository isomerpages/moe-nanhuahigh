The Physical Education (PE) department continues to cultivate positive habits in students through a rigorous PE and Healthy Habits programme. Focusing on not just physical health, our collaboration with other departments and committees allows students to also be aware of their mental, emotional and social well-being to develop themselves holistically. With the opportunity to learn a variety of sports and games, and participate in a range of activities, students can become competent in and passionate about pursuing an active, healthy lifestyle. Students can also learn to work together as a team and nurture class spirit as they acquire the knowledge, skills, right attitudes and values to understand the importance of maintaining fitness for their personal well-being.

 At the end of Term 1 and 2, students had the opportunity to engage in 2 days of level-wide activities, which further facilitated class-based and level-based bonding as they work together towards a common goal. Those were also days that students could destress and enjoy a fun-filled day of activities to celebrate the hard work they have put in throughout the term. Not forgetting the mental and affective domain, students also had sessions to show their gratitude and practice mindfulness as part of their holistic well-being development.

    "I feel that the PE calendar is a fun way to do different activities so that I would not be bored at home and I can be active. The workout app (Home Workout) is interesting and easy to use too.”  

Celine Tan, 408

    As PE lessons veered more towards acquiring theoretical knowledge, students were made to process their thoughts and express them using pen and paper. By drawing alignment between these theory lessons and the practical sessions, students now not only know “what to do” and “how to do”, but they also know “why they must do”. Even students who could not participate in physical lessons due to injury could be engaged in a theory lesson like this and it gives them a sense of belonging and success.  

    To encourage students to take ownership of their own physical health, students were tasked to create workouts and teach them to their peers. Modifying games was also part of the curriculum so that they can learn to be self-sufficient and be life-long learners. These lessons provided a platform for students to be creative and flexible in working with the constraints.

    Through the CnME modules offered by the department - ‘An Excycling Journey’ and ‘Eat, Play, Learn’ – students were able to explore their areas of interest that is beyond the PE curriculum. These programmes provided a platform for students not only to be further convinced of the benefits of engaging in physical activities, but also to build 21st century competencies such as love of learning, effective communication and collaboration.

    Promoting health at the workplace has been part of the department’s undertaking. The monthly SWEAT It Out! session saw staff members engaged in physical activities such as Tabata workouts, racquet games, and workstation workouts. By introducing the various physical activities, we hope to spur them to find every opportunity to move and stay active.  

  

    Despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic, which presented new and unforeseen challenges related to programme delivery, the PE department was flexible to adapt to the changes, continuing to work together towards developing self-directed and independent learners. Online applications and platforms became a growing presence in PE lessons, and were leveraged on to replace mass sporting events.

    The most prominent example of this was in the traditional Annual Road Run, where all school staff and students used to take part in a physical race. Instead of this, a Virtual Run was held instead. In addition, the Healthy Habits 2021 programme was implemented with the intention of cultivating life-long habits among students and staff to stay active and healthy.

    Termly challenges and holiday activities kept staff and students engaged in physical pursuits. With these strategies, we hope that staff and students will continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle in spite of the limitations imposed by the pandemic.
