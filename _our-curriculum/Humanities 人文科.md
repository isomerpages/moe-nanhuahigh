<p><strong>Humanities Department</strong>
</p>
<p>The Humanities department adopts an inquiry approach in sparking curiosity
and developing passion in the learning of Humanities. Through the multiple
learner-centred programmes, the department aims for students to be engaged
in authentic and experiential learning. These programmes have been designed
to provide a variety of enriching opportunities for students to collaborate,
explore and learn beyond the classroom. This year, our students have had
opportunities to experience these programmes which were customized to meet
their learning needs.</p>
<p><strong>Geographical Investigation</strong>
</p>
<p>In the learning of Geography, all Secondary 2 students were involved in
carrying out fieldwork investigations at Sungei Ulu Pandan. They learnt
about the impact of human activities on the environment and how the environment
could affect water quality and human survival. They collected and recorded
observations of physical features and human activities using field sketches,
annotated photographs, recording sheets and maps. In addition, they conducted
water quality tests to measure the turbidity, dissolved oxygen and pH levels
of water samples. These skills in data collection and analysis are vital
in geographical fieldwork when learning about the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Historical Investigation</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of their discovery of Singapore’s rich history, all Secondary
2 students embarked on an immersive learning journey to explore historical
artefacts and archival photographs at the National Museum. Through exploring
these innovative displays, they uncovered the nation's defining moments,
challenges and resilience of the people living during the transformative
periods of Singapore. This helped to deepen their understanding and appreciation
for the contributions made by the pioneer generations that have built Singapore
from a fishing village to a cosmopolitan nation today.</p>

<p><strong>Social Studies Issue Investigation</strong>
</p>
<p>The Social Studies Issue Investigation was a collaborative inquiry project
that tasked all Secondary 3 students to examine the complexity of a contemporary
issue in Singapore’s diverse society. The groups were guided to first identify
an issue that they were concerned about, followed by the creation of questionnaires
for the online surveys and face-to-face interviews. They then gathered
and analysed the data collected before making recommendations based on
sound reasoning to improve societal issues. This investigation provided
students with authentic opportunities to gain diverse perspectives from
Singaporeans on the issues and challenges in our society.</p>
<p><strong>Social Studies Issue Investigation Collaboration with Clementi Town Secondary</strong>
</p>
<p>From the Secondary 3 cohort, two classes collaborated with students from
Clementi Town Secondary for their Social Studies Issue Investigation project.
Under the guidance from Social Studies teachers from both schools, they
examined real-world issues that they were concerned with, and coordinated
their time and effort to meet each other online and in-person to plan and
carry out the investigations. Each group consisted of students from diverse
socio-cultural backgrounds. Equipped with their knowledge, understanding
and varied experiences, each team member contributed to the richness of
their discussions. There were new opportunities for them to learn from
one another, develop critical and reflective thinking, and appreciate the
multiple perspectives and complexities of the issues in our society.</p>
<p><strong>RICH Fest 2023</strong>
</p>
<p>Held on 27 October, the Humanities RICH Fest (Realising Innovation and
Creativity in the Humanities) caters to the development of creative, cultured
and confident students with a passion for the Humanities. This year’s theme
is on ASEAN and students from the Secondary 2 came up with interesting
and engaging presentations and activities for their peers to learn more
about ASEAN. They also incorporated their historical and geographical knowledge
and skills when doing their research on various aspects of ASEAN countries.
Through this event, students gained a deeper understanding of how to apply
what they learnt in the classroom to a real-life showcase to their friends
and teachers.</p>

<p><strong>NH ASEAN Forum 2023</strong>
</p>
<p>Held on 19 July, the Secondary 3 cohort participated in the inaugural
NH ASEAN Forum. The brainchild of the Humanities teachers, the forum aims
to provide opportunities for Nanhuarians to strengthen their understanding
and exposure towards Asia, particularly the ASEAN region.</p>

<p><strong><em>Learning about the civil-military relations in the ASEAN region</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The theme was Blurring the Lines: Military and Governance in ASEAN, where
students were tasked to conduct guided research on an ASEAN country of
their choice and present their findings. A Fireside Chat featuring our
Principal and Head of the Humanities Department was also held to discuss
the relevance and significance of ASEAN to Singapore, while the delegates
to the HCI Model ASEAN Summit shared their experiences and key takeaways.
In an intellectually charged atmosphere with a lively exchange of ideas,
it was a valuable learning experience for the cohort.</p>
