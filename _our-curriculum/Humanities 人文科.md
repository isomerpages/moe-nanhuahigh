<p><strong>Humanities Department</strong>
</p>
<p>The Humanities department adopts an inquiry approach in sparking curiosity
and developing passion in the learning of Humanities. Through the multiple
learner-centred programmes, the department aims for students to be engaged
in authentic and experiential learning. These programmes have been designed
to provide a variety of enriching opportunities for students to collaborate,
explore and learn beyond the classroom. This year, our students have had
opportunities to experience these programmes which were customized to meet
their learning needs.</p>
<p><strong>Geographical Investigation</strong>
</p>
<p>In the learning of Geography, all Secondary 2 students were involved in
carrying out fieldwork investigations at Sungei Ulu Pandan. They learnt
about the impact of human activities on the environment and how the environment
could affect water quality and human survival. They collected and recorded
observations of physical features and human activities using field sketches,
annotated photographs, recording sheets and maps. In addition, they conducted
water quality tests to measure the turbidity, dissolved oxygen and pH levels
of water samples. These skills in data collection and analysis are vital
in geographical fieldwork when learning about the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Historical Investigation</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of their discovery of Singapore’s rich history, all Secondary
2 students embarked on an immersive learning journey to explore historical
artefacts and archival photographs at the National Museum. Through exploring
these innovative displays, they uncovered the nation's defining moments,
challenges and resilience of the people living during the transformative
periods of Singapore. This helped to deepen their understanding and appreciation
for the contributions made by the pioneer generations that have built Singapore
from a fishing village to a cosmopolitan nation today.</p>

<p><strong>Social Studies Issue Investigation</strong>
</p>
<p>The Social Studies Issue Investigation was a collaborative inquiry project
that tasked all Secondary 3 students to examine the complexity of a contemporary
issue in Singapore’s diverse society. The groups were guided to first identify
an issue that they were concerned about, followed by the creation of questionnaires
for the online surveys and face-to-face interviews. They then gathered
and analysed the data collected before making recommendations based on
sound reasoning to improve societal issues. This investigation provided
students with authentic opportunities to gain diverse perspectives from
Singaporeans on the issues and challenges in our society.</p>
<p><strong>Social Studies Issue Investigation Collaboration with Clementi Town Secondary</strong>
</p>
<p>From the Secondary 3 cohort, two classes collaborated with students from
Clementi Town Secondary for their Social Studies Issue Investigation project.
Under the guidance from Social Studies teachers from both schools, they
examined real-world issues that they were concerned with, and coordinated
their time and effort to meet each other online and in-person to plan and
carry out the investigations. Each group consisted of students from diverse
socio-cultural backgrounds. Equipped with their knowledge, understanding
and varied experiences, each team member contributed to the richness of
their discussions. There were new opportunities for them to learn from
one another, develop critical and reflective thinking, and appreciate the
multiple perspectives and complexities of the issues in our society.</p>
<p><strong>RICH Fest</strong>
</p>
<p>On 18 July 2024, the Humanities Department organised our annual RICH FEST
(Realising Humanities and Creativity in the Humanities) carnival with the
objectives of cultivating love for Geography and History and enriching
Secondary 2 students with out-of-textbook knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus of this year’s theme was ASEAN countries. From skits on historical
events to captivating infographics that capture facts about the natural
geography found in a specific country, students gained deeper insights
on each ASEAN country and their people’s way of life.</p>
<p>This carnival has fostered leadership, teamwork and creativity among students.
Friendships were forged during the interactions with peers from different
classes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>NH ASEAN Forum</strong>
</p>
<p>Themed ‘ASEAN and China: Collaboration or Contestation?’, the 2024 NH
ASEAN Forum brought our Secondary 3 students through an inquiry process
to uncover the collaborative and contested areas in ASEAN's relationship
with China. This process involves context-setting to spark curiosity about
ASEAN's relationship with China, guided research to gather and make sense
of data, as well as interactive presentations to students from other secondary
schools and junior colleges. As a result, students have not only shown
a deeper appreciation of Singapore's place in the region and the world,
but also developed deeper conceptual and contextual understandings of issues
related to ASEAN.</p>
<p><strong>Humanities Spotlight Series</strong>
</p>
<p>The Humanities Spotlight series is a termly publication featuring infographics
that address the latest contemporary local and global issues. These infographics
present information in bite-sized, easily digestible, and visually appealing
formats. To enhance student learning and understanding of real-world topics,
multimedia resources are embedded within the infographics. This approach
creates an engaging and dynamic learning environment that fosters curiosity
and encourages self-directed learning. Through this the department aims
to provide a holistic education by extending beyond the standard curriculum
to cultivate dispositions like empathy and perspective-taking. By focusing
on current local and global issues, the series offers valuable historical
context, geographical insights, and social awareness.</p>
