<p><strong>RICHFest (Realising Innovation and Creativity in the Humanities Festival)</strong>
</p>
<p>One of the programmes experienced by all Secondary 2 students is the department’s
RICHFest which aims for students to apply Humanities in authentic settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In line with SG 60, RICHFest was organised this year with the theme of
‘Understanding Singapore: Past, Present and Future’. The Humanities department
integrated Historical Investigation with Geographical Investigation to
deepen students’ understanding of sustainable development in Singapore
neighbourhoods through experiential learning. The Secondary 2 students
looked into neighbourhoods’ past for their Historical Investigation and
examine the current use of the neighbourhood for their Geographical Investigation.
Based on the theme of sustainable development, the students then went on
to propose possible enhancements to the neighbourhoods for the future which
was then presented for RICHFest. The students demonstrated the ability
to integrate the two disciplines and applied their creativity to propose
sustainable ideas for the neighbourhoods in their projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Humanities Spotlight Series</strong>
</p>
<p>The Humanities Spotlight series is a termly publication featuring infographics
that address the latest contemporary local and global issues. These infographics
present information in bite-sized, easily digestible, and visually appealing
formats. To enhance student learning and understanding of real-world topics,
multimedia resources are embedded within the infographics. This approach
creates an engaging and dynamic learning environment that fosters curiosity
and encourages self-directed learning. Through this the department aims
to provide a holistic education by extending beyond the standard curriculum
to cultivate dispositions like empathy and perspective-taking. By focusing
on current local and global issues, the series offers valuable historical
context, geographical insights, and social awareness.&nbsp;</p>

<br><strong>Overseas Investigative Learning Journey to Vietnam</strong>
</p>
<p>To enrich students’ learning in authentic contexts as well as cross cultural
settings, the Humanities Department is organising an investigative learning
journey to Vietnam where students will be placing their skills and competencies
from their inquiry projects to use. In this learning journey, students
will visit Hanoi’s key sites and engage in Geographical, Historical and
Social Studies investigations. Some of the key sites are Ho Chi Minh’s
Mausoleum Complex, Hilton Hanoi Prison, Old Quarter, Sapa Museum, Fansipan
summit and Ta Van village. Students will also be watching the water puppet
show and interacting with Vietnamese students at a local school and sharing
about Singapore. As part of their learning, students will be visiting a
social enterprise to learn about inclusivity. Through this experiential
learning, students learnt how to apply Humanities in authentic settings
and interact with people who are from different cultures.</p>
