Parent Support Group (PSG), an integral part of the school, actively organises workshops to equip our members with parenting skills and family bonding sessions to strengthen family ties. We build connections with members and serve the school actively at various platforms.

### 2023
The Parent Support Group (PSG) continues to work closely with the school in engaging the parents. The PSG Exco warmly welcomed the Sec 1 parents during the inaugural Parent Networking and Learning Day in Term 1 this year, where the new Sec 1 parents got the chance to mingle with the Exco and fellow parents and also received valuable parenting strategies from the Student Development Team during the Strength-based Parenting Workshop.

The PSG also passionately supported the school in various school programmes such as Camp Horizon, Eco-Serve Week, Library Week and Night Study. Besides supporting the school in volunteering in school programmes, PSG also actively reach out to the parents through social media with posting about the school happenings and the involvements of the parent volunteers.
