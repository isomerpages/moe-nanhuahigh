Parent Support Group (PSG), an integral part of the school, actively organises workshops to equip our members with parenting skills and family bonding sessions to strengthen family ties. We build connections with members and serve the school actively at various platforms.

### 2022
The Parent Support Group (PSG) continues its steadfast support for the school in 2022. Parent volunteers were passionate in contributing their time and effort to school programmes such as Eco-Serve Week and Library Week. More than 40 parents guided students in the wrapping of dumplings during ACC lessons on Mid-Autumn Festival, helping to deepen our students’ understanding and appreciation for Chinese traditions. With the relaxation of Safe Management Measures, a face-to-face Welcome Tea for Secondary 1 parents was organised in Term 2. It was wonderful seeing parents interacting with one another at the on-site event and the Executive Committee reuniting in school. PSG also partners the school to promote workshops that meet the needs of parents.
