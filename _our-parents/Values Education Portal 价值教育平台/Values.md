<h2>Value-of-the-month (VOM)</h2><p>Value-of-the-month is a programme through which we engage students in the understanding of school values.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="01a_SchoolValues.jpg" src="/images/01a_SchoolValues.jpg"></div><h2>VOM Lessons in Nan Hua</h2><p>VOM lessons in Nan Hua aim to not only deepen students’ understanding of the school values, but also to get students to reflect deeply about the community around them and how they can&nbsp; practice these values in authentic settings. The lessons feature discussions, hands-on activities and reflection exercises of how these school values can be practised in real life. After which, students are given opportunities to practise these values to develop themselves and&nbsp; to benefit society. Ultimately, the goal is to nurture students to be world-ready individuals who embrace tradition and are champions of society.</p><h2>Ceremonial Walk</h2><p>The Ceremonial Walk is a dignified procession to inspire the values upon the memories and experiences of our students. This symbolic act embeds in them the importance of living out the school values, and in particular courtesy and righteousness.</p><p></p><p>The Ceremonial Walk ‘initiates’ our Sec 1 students into the Nan Hua Family as they walk in through the Archway of Courtesy and Righteousness. When they graduate in Sec 4, they will walk out of this Archway, symbolizing that they have acquired the school values, and reminding them that they should uphold these values as part of their identity as a Nanhuarian.</p><p></p>
