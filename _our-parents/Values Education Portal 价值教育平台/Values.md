<h2>Value-of-the-month (VOM)</h2><p>Value-of-the-month is a programme through which we engage students in the understanding of school values.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="01a_SchoolValues.jpg" src="/images/01a_SchoolValues.jpg"></div><p><strong>Loyalty </strong></p><p>Loyalty means selfless dedication and unwavering love for one’s country.

The lessons feature discussions, hands-on activities and reflection exercises of how these school values can be practised in real life. After which, students are given opportunities to practise these values to develop themselves and&nbsp; to benefit society. Ultimately, the goal is to nurture students to be world-ready individuals who embrace tradition and are champions of society.</p><h2>Ceremonial Walk</h2><p>The Ceremonial Walk is a dignified procession to inspire the values upon the memories and experiences of our students. This symbolic act embeds in them the importance of living out the school values, and in particular courtesy and righteousness.</p><p></p><p>The Ceremonial Walk ‘initiates’ our Sec 1 students into the Nan Hua Family as they walk in through the Archway of Courtesy and Righteousness. When they graduate in Sec 4, they will walk out of this Archway, symbolizing that they have acquired the school values, and reminding them that they should uphold these values as part of their identity as a Nanhuarian.</p><p></p><h2>Confucian Ethics</h2><p>The Nan Hua SAP Flagship Programme has Confucian Ethics Education as an essential component in our curriculum. The Confucian Ethics education curriculum focuses on values in action, with an emphasis on the promotion of societal values and humanitarian spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>Education begins at home. School and family education shapes a child’s values system and world-view. We believe that there is a need for a platform for parents to interact and engage their child on values education.&nbsp;As a SAP School, the setting up of Values Education portal would leverage on its existing bilingual advantage. The portal serves to promote the appreciation of Confucian Ethics and raises public awareness on values education.</p><p></p>
